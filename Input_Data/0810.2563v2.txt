abstract

SDSS J092712.65+294344.0 has been proposed as a candidate for a supermassive black hole ( 10^8.8~ ) ejected at high speed from the host galactic nucleus by gravitational radiation recoil,
or alternatively for a supermassive black hole binary. This is based on
a blueshift of 2650 \ of the broad emission lines (``b-system'') relative to the narrow emission lines
(``r-system'') presumed to reflect the galaxy velocity. New observations with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope ( ) confirm the essential features of the spectrum. We note a third redshift system,
characterized by weak,
narrow emission lines of \ and \ at an intermediate velocity 900~ redward of the broad line velocity (``i-system''). A composite spectrum of SDSS QSOs similar to 0927\ illustrates
the feasibility of detecting the calcium K absorption line in spectra of sufficient quality.
The i-system may represent the QSO host galaxy or a companion.
Photoionization requires the black hole to be 3~kpc from the r-system emitting gas,
implying that we are observing the system only 10^6~ after the recoil event and contributing to the
low probability of observing such a system. The \ observations give an upper limit of
10~ per year on the rate of change of the velocity difference between the r- and b-systems,
constraining the orbital phase in the binary model. These considerations and the
presence of a cluster of galaxies apparently containing 0927\ favor the idea that this system represents
a superposition of two AGN.

galaxies: active --- quasars: general --- black hole physics

Introduction

Simulations of binary black hole mergers show large recoil velocities
(``kicks'') of the final merged black hole resulting from
asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation.
predict a maximum recoil velocity of 4000~ for
equal mass black holes with maximal spin (a_*=1),
with the spins anti-aligned and lying in the orbital plane.
Kicks as large as 3300~ \ have been found in numerical simulations
for a_* = 0.92.
For a_* = 0.9, Baker et al (2008) predict that as many as
one-quarter of mergers will give kicks over
1000~ for random spin orientations and
mass ratios distributed in the range 0.25 to 1. For a binary supermassive
black hole ( 10^8~M_ ) formed during a galactic merger
, the kick may displace the black hole from the
galactic nucleus or eject it entirely [][and references
therein]merritt04. For a recoil occurring in an active galactic
nucleus (AGN) with an accretion disk, the inner disk will remain bound to
the black hole, providing fuel for continued AGN activity .
This might be observed as a QSO displaced from the
galactic nucleus , as a QSO with emission lines shifted relative to
the galactic velocity , as thermal emission from shocked gas in the disk
, or as flares from tidal disruption of stars bound
to the moving hole .
However, AGN rarely show displaced nuclei
, and bogda07 argue that accretion by the
merging black holes will align their spins in a way unfavorable for
large kicks.

bonning07 conducted a search for recoil candidates among QSOs in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They looked for cases in which the velocity of the broad emission lines differed substantially from that of the narrow lines. The inner disk and broad line region (BLR) should remain bound to the black hole, the narrow line region (NLR) will be left behind. Photoionization of the residual nuclear gas and the general interstellar medium by the displaced QSO should give narrow emission lines at the velocity of the host galaxy. bonning07 found many cases of shifted broad lines (as was previously known) up to 2600~ , but they attributed most cases to physical processes in the BLR rather than recoil. They listed several spectroscopic criteria to be satisfied by viable candidates for true kicks, including
symmetrical broad line profiles, agreement of the velocity of the broad \ and \ lines, and agreement of the profiles of the high and low ionization narrow lines. bonning07 listed two candidate objects that satisfied these criteria, with velocity shifts of 500~ .

komossa08 proposed the QSO SDSS J092712.65+294344.0 as a promising candidate for black hole recoil.
The object shows broad emission lines of \ and
\ at z_b = 0.6977 (b-system) and narrow emission lines at z_r = 0.7128 (r-system).
Portions of the spectrum are shown in Figures and ; see
komossa08 for the full \ spectrum with line identifications. The
\ and \ lines have symmetrical profiles with closely consistent blueshifts of 2650~ relative to the narrow lines. komossa08 identify the narrow lines with the host galaxy and the broad lines with a recoiling black hole ejected from the nucleus with a line-of-sight velocity of
2650~ toward the observer. The narrow lines have normal AGN line intensity ratios, with unusually narrow profiles (FWHM = 170~ ). There is no indication of broad lines at the redshift of the narrow lines. Unusual for QSOs with shifted broad lines, there is an additional set of narrow emission lines at the peak velocity of the broad lines. komossa08 suggest that the narrowness of the r-system line profiles is consistent with photoionization of gas in a galactic disk by an ionizing source displaced from the nucleus, and that
the b-system narrow lines may represent weakly bound gas moving with the black hole. They further argue that a chance superposition of two AGN with these properties is unlikely, and that the velocity difference is too large for a merger of two active galaxies in a cluster of galaxies.
More recently, bogda08 and dotti08 have proposed the alternative hypothesis that
0927\ represents a supermassive binary black hole system whose orbital velocity leads to
the velocity of the b-system while the r-system represents the host galaxy.

Here we present a new \ spectrum of
0927 that confirms the basic features of the system and sets limits on
variability. We note the presence of a third redshift system in 0927, which is closer to the broad line velocity and has implications for the interpretation of the system. We emphasize the importance of identifying the stellar absorption lines and discuss their possible presence at the intermediate redshift. We also consider photoionization constraints on the geometry and age of the system on the recoil hypothesis. Finally. we comment on the relative merits of the recoil, binary, and superposition hypotheses and potential
tests.

HET spectrum

In order to confirm the basic features of the spectrum and to search for possible stellar
absorption lines (see below), we observed 0927 using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at
McDonald Observatory. Spectra were obtained with the Low Resolution
Spectrograph (LRS) with the G2 grism and a 2~arcsec slit giving a spectral resolution
of FWHM = 410~ as measured from the night sky lines. Integrations of
40 minutes were obtained on the evenings of May 8 and May 9, 2008 (civil),
each divided into two cosmic ray splits. The data were reduced using standard
procedures. The relative flux calibration as a function of wavelength should be accurate,
but absolute calibration is not precise because of the nature of the , which has a changing
effective aperture during the integration. The flux-calibrated spectrum is shown in Figure .
The spectrum covers the observed wavelength range 4300 to 7250~ , which includes \ through \ but not the - \ region. The \ spectrum confirms the basic features
of the SDSS spectrum, including the r- and b-redshift systems representing the strong
narrow lines and the broad lines, respectively.
The equivalent widths for the \ and SDSS spectra, measured with a Gaussian profile
with the IRAF task SPLOT IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. respectively are 11.0~ \ and
10.1~ \ for ~ 3727 and 3.7~ \ and 3.3~ \ for ~ 3869, consistent within an estimated 10\
This sets a corresponding limit on continuum variability during the 3.3 year interval between the dates of the SDSS (2005 January 19) and \ spectra.

The binary black hole model of and predicts a secular shift of the
b-system narrow lines because of the orbital motion (see discussion below). In this interpretation the
r-system narrow lines represent the host galaxy and should be a stable frame of reference. We have measured the velocity difference between the peaks of the r-system and b-system narrow lines in the SDSS and \ spectra.
The results in \ for ( , ) are (2565 30, 2575 20) for ~ 3727,
(2679 20, 2694 30) for ~ 3869, and
(2811 30, 2756 40) for ~ 3426). (The errors are based on the extreme reasonable cursor positions and on a comparison of cursor settings by eye with Gaussian fits in SPLOT constrained to fit the line core and exclude the blue wing.)
The corresponding velocity change in
the sense v_rb v_r - v_b is +10 36, +14 26, and -55 50
for , , and , respectively. Note that this refers to the full 3.3~year interval.
The mean weighted by the inverse square error is
v_rb = -2 23 for all three lines and v_rb = +12 25 for \ and \
only. The annual rates of change are d v_rb/d t = -1 7~ \ per year for all three
lines and d v_rb/d t = +4 8~ \ per year for \ and \ only.
Implications for the binary model are discussed below.

The third redshift

Motivated by the suspected presence of a stellar Ca K line at an intermediate redshift between
z_b and z_r (see below), we examined the spectrum of 0927 for possible
emission lines at such a redshift. The SDSS spectrum (Figure ) does indeed
show a weak, narrow emission line at 8525.5 1.0
(z=0.7028 0.0002). This feature has a flux of (23 5) 10^-17~
and an observed-frame equivalent width (EW) of 4 1~ .
The corresponding ~ 4959 line may be present
at the expected wavelength and intensity but is obscured by noise and night sky lines.
There is also a weak, narrow emission line at 6347.0 1.0 (Figure )
that corresponds to
~ 3727.4 at z=0.7028 0.0003.
This feature has a flux of (16 4) 10^-17~
and an observed-frame equivalent width (EW) of 1.7 0.4~ .
The close agreement of the \ and \
redshifts indicates the reality of the system. We call this intermediate redshift system
the ``i-system" and take z_i = 0.7028. The \ spectrum confirms the presence of
the i-system \ line at a velocity and intensity (EW 2.8 0.7~ ) consistent with SDSS.
The upper limit
on any narrow \ emission line at z_i is about one-third the flux in 5007.
These line intensities are consistent with emission from a low luminosity AGN
or with H II region emission corresponding to a star formation rate
of about one solar mass per year .

The i-system offers an alternative
candidate for the host galaxy of the QSO, or it may represent a close companion. In either
case, the presence of a galaxy at a velocity close to the broad-line velocity lends
credence to the possibility that the r-system may not represent the host galaxy and
that the broad line system may be an ordinary QSO. The i-system could also represent
gas ejected from the QSO.

Stellar absorption features

The presence of stellar lines at a redshift
close to that of the broad emission lines of 0927\ would undermine the recoil
hypothesis.
The stellar features from the host galaxy in QSO spectra are typically quite weak,
particularly at higher redshifts, because of
the predominance of the AGN continuum. The
\ K line at 3933 is often the most visible
feature . If the black hole mass is proportional to the
host galaxy luminosity [][and references therein]lauer07,
the ratio of galaxy to QSO continuum
should scale inversely as the Eddington ratio L/ .
From the width of the broad emission lines and the
continuum luminosity, komossa08 find
= 10^8.8~ for the black hole in 0927,
giving L/ = 10^-1.0.
As a guide to the expected strength of the Ca II lines in 0927,
we constructed a composite spectrum using QSOs
from SDSS Data Release 5 (DR5) having 0.6 z 0.8 and -1.4 < L/ < -0.6,
similar to z and L/ for 0927. The spectra were processed in the manner
described by salviander07 for their ``HO3'' sample, shifted to the rest wavelength scale using the SDSS redshift, and scaled to a common value of at 4000.
Figure shows the region of the \ lines in the composite spectrum for the 2181 QSOs selected in this fashion. The ~K line is evident at 3933,
with a depth of about 5\
spectrum of vandenberk01.

The companion line in the \ doublet at 3968 is masked by
the narrow ~ 3968 and broad \ at 3970 emission lines,
but an approximate subtraction is possible.
We subtracted \ using I( 3968) = 0.31 I( 3869)
and a Gauss-Hermite fit to the profile of 3869 . For , we examined the Balmer decrement
in a generic model for a BLR cloud computed with version 07.02.00 of the photoionization code
CLOUDY, most recently described by ferland98. This was a plane-parallel model
with solar abundances, gas density N = 10^10~ , ionization parameter
U = 10^-2, the ``table power law" ionizing continuum, and a stop column density of
10^22~ . The model gave
I( )/I( ) = 0.60, compared with 0.62 for low density ``Case B''
and 0.53 to 0.55 in several other CLOUDY models with the same density but different ionizing
continua and larger column densities. We
subtracted \ using a Gaussian profile with a wavelength-integrated flux of
0.6 F( ) and the same FWHM as .
The subtraction reveals the Ca~H line.
The depth of the K line is about 7\
in rough agreement with the expected value for this range of L/ on the
basis of the black hole - galaxy luminosity relationship of Lauer et al. (2007) for bright ellipticals.

We initially suspected the presence of a weak Ca~K absorption line at a redshift similar
to z_i, based on visual inspection of the SDSS spectrum. We performed a subtraction of the r- and b-system \ and \ lines from the SDSS spectrum of 0927\ in the manner described above. The resulting
spectrum (Figure ) shows no convincing K line at any of the three redshifts.
The K line is not evident in the \ spectrum (Figure ), which
has higher signal-to-noise.
We estimate an upper limit of 10\
discussed above. Detection of host galaxy absorption lines is an important goal for future
observations.

Geometrical constraints

The likelihood of observing a high velocity recoil such as proposed for 0927
depends on the length of time during which it would have the current appearance.
komossa08 suggest an upper limit of 10^9~yr for the post-kick duration of
AGN fueling, if the
mass of the bound disk is close to that of the black hole and the efficiency of
luminosity production is as high as expected for a rapidly spinning hole.
blecha08 estimate
a bound disk mass of 10^7~ , based on a disk model that
takes account of the disk's self gravity, giving a lifetime of ~ 10^7~yr. The object likely
would not maintain its current appearance over even this shorter time.
At the observed velocity, the black hole would reach
30~kpc from the galactic nucleus in 10^7.1~yr, by which time
the r-system narrow lines would fade as the galactic ISM intercepted a diminishing fraction
of the ionizing continuum from the recoiling AGN.

A still tighter constraint follows from the ionization equilibrium of the gas emitting
the r-system narrow lines. The r-system
~ 3728.8, 3726.0 doublet is marginally resolved in the
SDSS spectrum, with equal intensities.
Given the \ redshift, the observed wavelength of
6386.0 0.2~ \ of the \ doublet also supports equal intensities.
For r = I(3728.8)/I(3726.0) = 1.0 0.2, based on the appearance of the doublet and the mean wavelength, the ``NEBULAR'' software http://stsdas.stsci.edu/nebular gives
N_e = 380~ (range 140 to 670~ ). The corresponding value
of the \ doublet ratio I(6717)/I(6730) is 1.12, a typical NLR value
. In the recoil model,
the ionizing source for the r-system lines is the broad line AGN.
The observed AGN continuum flux at 5100
rest wavelength corresponds to = 10^44.96~ ,
giving 9 = 10^45.92~ following kaspi00.
If we take an ionizing luminosity of 0.3 and a mean ionizing photon
energy of 2 Ryd, then the ionizing photon luminosity is Q = 10^55.76~s^-1,
consistent with the broad \ luminosity of 10^45.25~ . The uncertainty in Q may
be 0.3~dex, based on the assumptions. NLR models
with CLOUDY (solar abundances, density N = 10^3~ , and either a L_ ^-1 or
``Table AGN'' ionizing continuum) reproduce the / \ line ratio of
0927 for an ionization parameter U /Nc = 10^-2.5 0.2, where
= Q/4 R^2. For N = 380~
and Q = 10^55.76~s^-1, this
places the ionizing source at a distance of 3.5~kpc from the
gas. This is a plausible distance in terms of allowing gas in a galactic disk to
intercept a substantial fraction of the ionizing radiation and give
the strong narrow lines of the r-system. The derived radius depends on parameters
as R Q^1/2 N^-1/2 U^-1/2. This gives an uncertainty of 0.23~dex in R
if we add the three contributions in quadrature, or 0.8~dex if we force each uncertainty
toward the small R or large R extreme.

At 2650~ , the
recoiling black hole requires only 10^6.1~ to reach 3~kpc from the
galactic nucleus. Thus, we are catching this object at a fortuitous
moment, if it is indeed a recoil event. A similar photoionization argument is given
by bogda08 and heckman08.

At a distance of 3~kpc from the galactic nucleus, the projected angular separation
is 0.4 ~arcsec. The angle of the recoil velocity to the line of slight may be
small, since the radial velocity of 2650~ is close to the maximum theoretical
kick velocity of 4000~ . Thus the angular offset of the AGN from the host galaxy
nucleus may or may not be resolvable by \ in the recoil picture.

Discussion

Superposition in a Cluster?

The possibility of chance superposition of a second AGN was rejected as improbable by .
The SDSS image of 0927\ appears point-like, and the SDSS spectrograph fibers have a diameter
of 3~arcsec. The alignment must be within 1~arcsec on the sky.
From the overall QSO luminosity function ,
the odds of a chance superposition within 1~arcsec and within 2650~ is only 10^-8
for a given QSO. This assumes that narrow line QSOs have
similar abundance to their broad line counterparts. However, the probability is substantially
enhanced by clustering.
Given the existence of a broad line QSO in a cluster in the first place, what is the
likelihood of a second, superimposed narrow line AGN?
A massive cluster is needed to support the observed velocity
difference. Given an incidence of AGN per galaxy
at this redshift of 10^-2 [][and references therein]shi08,
it may be reasonable to assume
that there typically is one additional narrow line QSO in the cluster.
For a cluster radius of
1~Mpc, the probability of a superposition within 1~arcsec is ~10^-4.3.
This suggests that several such superpositions may be present among the 10^5 QSOs in SDSS, or even the subset with z < 0.8 having \ in range.

The SDSS images
show a number of galaxies in the vicinity of 0927\ whose photometric redshifts
, given by the SDSS data server
http://www.sdss.org, are consistent with 0927\ within the errors of 0.2.
The SDSS photometric query server gives four galaxies of magnitude i = 20.0 to 22.2 within 0.5 arcminute (200~kpc). One, with i=21.6 and photometric redshift 0.63 0.25, is only 4.7 arcsec (33~kpc) from the QSO. Other apparent companions within a few arcsec are visible in the images.
An apparent cluster of galaxies lies about 0.5~arcmin to the southwest
of 0927. On the eastern edge of this group, 33~arcsec SSW of the QSO, is
SDSS J092711.93+294312.3 with i=20.3, M_i = -22.8, and z_phot =0.66 0.02,
close to the redshift of 0927.

Consistent with the presence of close companions is the intermediate redshift system
that we have identified in 0927.
The broad lines have a line-of-sight velocity of only 900~
with respect to this redshift, reasonable for orbital motion
in a galactic merger or a collision or superposition
in a cluster of galaxies. The black hole mass of 10^8.8~ corresponds to
a stellar velocity dispersion of = 300~ by the local \
relationship . Orbital velocities of several
times \ can occur in mergers .
The velocity of the r-system
narrow lines is 1700~ relative to z_i. This is large for a galactic merger but
is possible in a cluster of galaxies .

While this manuscript was in preparation, a preprint by heckman08 appeared suggesting that
0927\ is a high-redshift analog of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1275. This object has two sets
of narrow emission lines separated by 3000~ representing two interacting galaxies.
These authors also note the apparent cluster in the vicinity of 0927, and they suggest that
the r-system lines of 0927\ may be gas in an interacting galaxy photoionized by the QSO continuum.

A Recoiling Black Hole?

komossa08 note that the b-system
narrow lines are rather broad and asymmetrical and suggest that this supports a special nature for the object as opposed to a superposition. However, wider forbidden lines are
associated larger \ and L. The b-system \ widths of 460~
resemble the average value of 444~ for the QSOs of salviander07 having
> 10^45~ and > 10^8.5~ , similar to 0927.
Blue wings on \ do occur at velocities similar to 0927 (-1500~ from the line peak). Our composite SDSS QSO spectrum shows such a blue wing, although not as strong as in 0927.

How unlikely is a combination of parameters giving a line-of-sight
recoil velocity of 2650~ ? As noted above, extrapolation of numerical results indicates a maximum possible kick of 4000~ for equal mass holes with maximal spins anti-aligned and lying in the orbital plane. baker08 find that the recoil velocity varies as ^3, where
q/(1+q)^2 and q = m_1/m_2 < 1 is the black hole mass ratio. If other parameters
are optimal for a 4000~ \ kick, then a kick of 2650~ \ is possible for q > 0.5. In
the cosmological merger simulations of sesana07, merger mass ratios are
fairly uniformly distributed in log~q for their ``large seeds" scenario. If a luminous QSO typically involves a major merger with q > 10^-1, then a fraction
10^-0.5 of all QSOs may have a mass ratio capable of giving the required kick.
Spins of black holes in AGN are not well determined, but it is commonly believed that
they are often a_* = 0.9 or larger [e.g.,][]fabian05, consistent with
kicks of 3000~ or larger if the other parameters are optimal .
campa07a find that the kick velocity varies sinusoidally with
the initial spin direction of each hole relative to its linear momentum.
Assuming a distribution in q above 10^-0.5 and a_* above 0.9, the typical
kick for perfect spin alignment will be some average over the range 2650 and 4000~ .
If this requires that the two spins must be anti-aligned such that cos\, > 0.9,
and that the common axis lie in the orbital plane within a similar tolerance,
then a fraction 10^-2 of randomly aligned mergers will have the needed alignment.
If objects with a true kick between 2650 and 4000~ have a typical value 3300~ ,
then a fraction 10^-0.7 will have a kick over 2650~
projected onto the line of sight to the observer, assuming that
redshifted or blueshifted kicks would equally attract notice. Then
the fraction of QSOs whose line-of-sight kick exceeds 2650~ will be
~ 10^-0.5 10^-2 10^-0.7 = 10^-3.2. We have argued that
0927\ is being observed in a stage of evolution lasting only 10^6~yr after the recoil event.
If we assume that typical QSOs shine for a Salpeter time of 10^7.6~yr, then the
odds of catching a particular QSO in the 0927\ stage is only 10^-1.6.
Altogether, this gives a probability of only ~ 10^-4.9 that a QSO will show a kick of
the magnitude of 0927. The SDSS DR6 has 90,000 QSOs at z < 2.3, of which approximately
one-fourth have z < 0.8 allowing observation of the \ lines. The expected number
of QSOs with kicks over 2650~ is therefore approximately 10^-0.4. This
very approximate estimate suggests that finding one example
of a large kick in the SDSS data base is not altogether implausible. This assumes
(1) that spin orientations are random, (2) that spin magnitudes are large, and (3) that
the final merger occurs during the QSO phase. If some physical process tends to align the
spins, as proposed by bogda07, then large kicks will not occur.

A Supermassive Black Hole Binary?

The binary black hole model of bogda08 and dotti08
assumes that the broad lines are associated with the less massive black hole of the pair, whose orbital
motion gives rise to the blueshift of the b-system lines while the r-system reflects the host galaxy velocity.
The model has the advantage that the
binary may be in a long lived stage of evolution. This may be as much as 10^2 times longer than
the observable phase of the recoil scenario, before the QSO moves too far from the galaxy.
However, the binary model is constrained by our limit dv/dt < 10~ per year on the rate of change of the velocity separation between the r- and b-systems (see ). The rate of change
of the line-of-sight velocity u_2 of the secondary black hole M_2, identified with the b-system
spectral features, is given by
bogda08 as
du_2/dt (88~ )(1+q)^2\,M_2,8^-1\,q_0.1\,s_i^-3\,s_ ^-4\,c_ ,
where q_0.1 10 M_2/M_1, M_2,8 = M_2/(10^8~ ),
i is the inclination of the orbital axis to the line-of-sight,
s_i sin~i/sin~45 ,
s_ sin~ /sin~45 ,
and c_ cos~ /cos~45 .
There is a range of orbital phase
around = 0 (inferior conjunction) and = 180 for which du_2/dt exceeds
the observational limit. For some parameters, this
requires the the orbital phase to be close to quadrature where dv/dt is zero ( = 90
or 270 ). The severity of the constraint depends on the system parameters. For larger
black hole masses, the period is longer, the orbital acceleration is smaller, and the constraint
on is less severe. For small i, the orbital velocity and acceleration are large and
the constraint on is severe. A modest inclination may be favored
by the unified model of AGN. dotti08 suggest a model with
M_1 = 6 10^8~ , M_2 = 1.7 10^9~ , and i = 40 .
(This large M_2 may stretch the upper limit on the Ca K line in .)
For these parameters, our constraint du_2/dt < 10~ restricts to be
within 12 of quadrature, corresponding to 13\
Alternatively, bogda08 argue that in the binary model, the broad emission-line width may not
give a valid indication of the AGN black hole mass (M_2 in the binary model).
From the observed X-ray luminosity,
an assumed bolometric correction, and the Eddington limit, they argue for a lower limit
of M_2 > 5 10^7~ . They also argue that M_2 should be substantially less
than M_1 in order for the AGN luminosity of M_1 to be relatively unimportant,
consistent with a single set of broad emission lines in the observed spectrum.
For M_2,8 = 0.5 and M_1,8 = 5, the allowed azimuth range around quadrature
is ( 8, 3, 0.9 ) for i = 45, 30, 20 , respectively.
We would be observing the binary in a special portion of only 10^-1 of
its orbital period, somewhat offsetting the advantage of the binary model as
a long lived configuration.

Other issues for the binary model, as noted by heckman08, include the presence of
strong \ emission in the b-system. This is difficult to account for at the densities n_e > 10^6~
derived by dotti08 for the tidal gap in the accretion disk that is the proposed source of the b-system narrow lines. Also of interest is how the binary model would give the observed, normal broad line profiles and the close redshift agreement of the b-system broad and narrow lines.

More exotic interpretations of 0927 can be imagined. For example, if the host galaxy
is indeed at an intermediate redshift, the system might be
a slingshot event in which a merging triple black hole system has ejected one black hole
at +1700~ while the the remaining binary rebounded toward the observer at -900~ . Problematic in such a picture is how the r-system object could retain or
reacquire an NLR with line widths of only 170~
after experiencing a kick of 1700~ .

Conclusion

The key question about 0927\ is whether it is indeed a high velocity recoil or some other dramatic event.
Confirmation of such a recoil would be an important confirmation of recent
predictions of numerical relativity. Additional observations of the candidate system are needed
to establish its true nature. komossa08 note the importance of
obtaining \ imaging to resolve the recoiling AGN from its host galaxy.
Most essential is to establish the velocity of the host galaxy; detection
of stellar features close to the b-system (broad line) velocity would suggest a normal
QSO at rest in its host galaxy.
We have argued that the \ lines provide an opportunity to
do this with high quality spectra. Other stellar features may be more difficult,
given the presence of AGN emission lines near the G-band, the Mg b-band,
and the Na D lines. The infrared calcium triplet, seen in the composite AGN
spectrum of vandenberk01, may be an alternative.

Also important are
imaging and spectroscopic studies of the environment of 0927 to establish
the nature of the galaxy cluster that apparently contains the QSO.
If the velocities of the neighboring
galaxies resemble the b-system (broad line) redshift
of 0927\ this will weigh against a recoil or binary model.
Finally, if the narrow lines of the r-system come from the ISM of the host galaxy,
photoionized by a displaced QSO, spectroscopic anomalies might be expected.
For example, in the geometry deduced above, the QSO radiation flux reaching
the r-system gas is similar to that in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.
Iron remains depleted into grains in these H II regions, whereas it is gaseous
in the NLR of AGN. The intensity of emission lines such as ~ 6087
in the r-system of 0927\ may be a diagnostic. Also, the \ lines of AGN are
often broader than the lower ionization lines. Confirmation of this for the
r-system lines of 0927\ would indicate a normal AGN with the ionizing source in
the center of the NLR. This would argue against recoil and against the variant
of the superposition model in which the r-system lines are the ISM of a passing non-active
galaxy photoionized by the main AGN .

Pending such studies,
the existence of a a third velocity system in the spectrum of 0927\ as noted
here, relatively close to the broad line velocity, together with the presence of a substantial cluster
apparently containing 0927, suggests that the superposition hypothesis deserves attention.
