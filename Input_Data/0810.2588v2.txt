abstract
Studying the earliest stages in the birth of stars is crucial

for understanding how they form.

Brown dwarfs with masses between that of stars and planets
are not massive

enough to maintain stable hydrogen-burning fusion reactions during most

of their lifetime.

Their origins are subject to much debate in recent literature because their

masses are far below the typical mass where core collapse is expected to occur.

We present the first confirmed evidence that brown dwarfs undergo a phase of molecular

outflow that is typical of young stars. Using the Submillimeter Array,
we have obtained a map of a bipolar molecular outflow from

a young brown dwarf.
We estimate an outflow mass of 1.6 10^-4 M_ and a mass-loss rate of
1.4 10^-9 M_ . These values are over two orders of magnitude
smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri stars.
From our millimiter continuum data and our own analysis of Spitzer infrared
photometry, we estimate that the brown dwarf has a disk with a mass
of 8 10^-3 M_ and an outer disk radius of 80 AU.

Our results demonstrate that the bipolar

molecular outflow operates down to planetary masses, occurring in

brown dwarfs as a scaled-down version of the universal process seen in young stars.

Introduction

Star formation starts with collapse, accretion and launching of material

as a bipolar outflow .
It is thought that brown dwarfs could
undergo the same stages of formation as stars and that they have a common
origin .
However the typical masses of brown dwarfs, 15--75~M_ J,
are far below
the typical Jeans mass in molecular clouds, and hence it is difficult to make a large
number of them by direct gravitational collapse. Several brown dwarf formation
mechanisms have been proposed (see whitworth
and references therein), and more observations are needed to
improve our understanding of the role of each of them.

Recent observational evidences for accretion, and optical jets
have been found in

young brown dwarfs .
However there is no firm evidence up to now to demonstrate that the brown dwarf formation

involves the bipolar molecular outflow process

as seen in young stars.

In the case of low-mass stars,
the molecular outflow plays a vital role

to testing the low-mass star formation theory .

Therefore, the detection of molecular outflows provides a key piece of

information on the earliest phase of the brown dwarf formation and allows us
to constrain the low-mass star formation theory in the sub-stellar domain.

In this Letter, we present millimeter observations

of the young brown dwarf ISO-Oph~102 in the Ophiuchi dark cloud.
We detect a

bipolar molecular outflow from the brown dwarf, demonstrating that this outflow mechanism
as seen in young stars continues to operate down to the masses of brown dwarfs.

We show that the outflow mass is much smaller than typical values found

in low-mass stars by two to three orders of magnitude.

We also combine our radio data with infrared data to estimate disk parameters.

The infrared spectrum of ISO-Oph~102
shows strong crystalline silicate features. This demonstrates

dust processing in the protoplanetary disk of the brown dwarf.

The coexistence of the molecular outflow with the crystallization of dust grains
could be of importance for models of planet formation.

Sec.~2 presents the millimeter observations and the data reduction,
Sec.~3. discusses the physical properties of the bipolar molecular outflow,
the disk parameters, and the crystalline silicate features in
ISO-Oph~102, Sec.~4 summarizes our results.

Observations and data reduction

ISO-Oph~102 (or [GY92]~204), a young M6 dwarf
initially identified by greene, is

located in the Ophiuchi dark cloud at a distance of

125~parsecs .

Its estimated mass is 60~M_ J .
This value is below the Hydrogen-burning limit and in good agreement
with the dynamically measured mass one of an M6.5 dwarf of 55~M_ J at the same age
(see stassun). ISO-Oph~102 is therefore a young
bona-fide brown dwarf.
The presence of the Lithium absorption in its optical spectrum

supports its brown dwarf nature .

Strong evidences for the presence of an accretion disk

have been reported . The blue-shifted optical jet
component was discovered by whelan05.

The optical visibility of ~Oph~102 suggests that the source

corresponds to a class II object in the star formation phase,

a class with an accreting circumstellar

disk and the protostar at this stage is the so-called

classical T Tauri star.

We have observed ISO-Oph~102 with the receiver band at 230~GHz of the SMA
The Submillimeter Array is a joint project between the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and
the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
and is funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the Academia Sinica. .
Both 2 GHz-wide sidebands which are separated

by 10 GHz were used. The SMA correlator was configured with high spectral

resolution bands of 512 channels per chunk of 104~MHz for ^12CO, ^13CO,

and C^18O J=2 1 lines, giving a channel spacing of 0.27~km~s^-1.

A lower resolution of 3.25~MHz per channel was set up for the remainder of

each sideband. The quasars 1625-254 and 3C~279 have been observed for gain

and passband calibration, respectively. Mars were used for

flux calibration. The data were calibrated using the MIR software package

and further analysis was carried out with the MIRIAD package adapted

for the SMA.

The compact configuration was used, resulting a synthesized beam of

3''.60~ ~2''.43 with a position angle of 8.5^ .

The rms (root mean square) sensitivity was about 3~mJy for the continuum,

using both sidebands and 0.2~Jy~beam^-1 per channel for

the line data. The primary FWHM (full width at half maximum)

beam is about 55''~at the observed frequencies.
The integrated flux density from the dust continuum emission was 7 3~mJy

measured at the brown dwarf position.

Discussion

An overlay of a near-infrared image and

the integrated intensity in the carbon monoxide (CO J=2-1) line

emission is shown in Figure 1.

Two spatially resolved blue- and red-shifted
CO components are symmetrically displaced
on opposite sides of the brown dwarf position, with

the size of each lobe of about 8'' corresponding

to 1000~AU in length.
This is similar to the typical pattern of bipolar molecular outflows

as seen in young stars .

The two outflow components with a wide range of velocity (Figure 2)

suggests a bow shock structure, an effect of the interaction

between the jet propagation and the ambient material, which appears very similar

to the bow shock phenomena as seen in young stars .

Such a CO outflow morphology suggests that

the jet-driven bow shock model (e.g., masson) may be at work in ~Oph~102.

Following the standard manner , we calculate the

outflow properties. We use a value of 35~K

for the excitation temperature, and we derive a lower limit to

the outflow mass of 3.2 10^-5 M_ . If we correct for optical depth

with a typical value of 5 , we obtain an upper limit

to the outflow mass of 1.6 10^-4 M_ . This

value is smaller than the ones observed in young stars

by three orders of magnitude.

To estimate the outflow inclination, we combine our SMA data with archival

infrared data of the Spitzer Space Telescope.

For the infrared photometry, we use the archival basic calibrated data (PIDs: 58, 177)

that were reduced with IRAF IRAF is distributed by the
National Optical Astronomy Observatories,
which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research
in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National
Science Foundation.
to measure flux densities.
Disk modeling is performed

as the previous works (see riaz and references therein).

The circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope,
bipolar cavities,

and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium.

The disk density is proportional to ^- ,

where is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane,

and is the radial density exponent.

The disk scale height increases with radius, h=h_0( / R_*)^ ,

where h_0 is the scale height at R_* (the brown dwarf radius)

and is the flaring power.

Stellar parameters are obtained from natta04,

and an accretion rate of 10^-9 M_ ~yr^-1 is used.

The NextGen atmosphere file for an effective temperature

T_eff of 2700~K,

and log g = 3.5, where g is the surface gravity,

is used to fit the atmosphere spectrum of the central sub-stellar source.

The disk shows some flaring longward of 10 ,

and the best model-fit was obtained using a disk mass of 8 10^-3 M_ ,

an inclination angle between 63^ and 66^ ,

an outer disk radius of 80 AU, and an inner disk radius equal to R_ sub, where R_ sub

is the dust sublimation radius: 1~R_ sub 6.8~R_ .

There is thus no inner hole in the disk as it would have to be larger than R_ sub.

The outer disk radius and the disk mass are well-constrained by the millimeter observations.

A more face-on inclination can be ruled out as it results in larger-than-observed mid- and

far-infrared fluxes.
Figure 3 presents the best fit

from the disk modeling obtained using a disk mass of 8 10^-3 M_ ,

an inclination angle between 63^ and 66^ ,

an outer disk radius of 80 AU, resulting in a projected disk radius

of 32-36 AU.

This immediately explains the non-detection of the red-shifted optical jet component,
estimated to be about 15~AU in length as reported

in the previous observation . Since the projected disk radius is larger

than the jet length, the disk therefore hides the red-shifted jet component

from our view.

We use the observed maximum flow velocity of 2.2 km~s^-1 and apply

a correction for the outflow inclination to compute upper limit

values for the kinematic and

dynamic parameters.
We find that the momentum is P=1.4 10^-4M_ ~km~s^-1,

the energy is E=3.1 10^-4M_ ~km^2~s^-2,

the force is F=5.9 10^-8M_ ~km~s^-1~yr^-1,

and the mechanical luminosity is L=2.1 10^-5~L_ , where L_

is the solar luminosity. A correction for the optical depth factor of 5 and

a missing flux factor of 3 for SMA will increase these upper limit values

by a factor of 15.

Using the lower value of the outflow mass and

a correction factor of 10 applied for the outflow duration time ,

we derive the outflow mass-loss rate of

1.4 10^-9M_ ~yr^-1, which is smaller

than a typical value for T Tauri stars by two orders of magnitude.
One should note that
these values are roughly estimated, depending on the correction factor values
used in the calculation.
One should also note that the outflow mass and the mass loss rate values from ISO-Oph 102 appear
similar to that from L1014-IRS , suggesting that they share
the same origin. However as clearly stated in huard L1014-IRS could be an embedded
protostar or a proto-brown dwarf, corresponding to the earliest stages of star
or brown dwarf formation processes, respectively.
More observations are needed to confirm the L1014-IRS nature and
study the connection between ISO-Oph 102 and L1014-IRS
in the whole formation phase.

We also examine the possibility that the emission might be due to bound motions
and not outflow emission. This would require
an interior mass of 2.7M_ for an outflow size of
1000~AU with a velocity of 2.2~km~s^-1, which is significant larger
than the core mass of < 0.4~M_ within the same radius .
We therefore conclude that the detected emission is from the outflow.

The IRS infrared (7.5-14.3 )
spectra of ISO-Oph~102
whose the basic-calibrated data were downloaded from the Spitzer archive (PID: 3499)
and reduced using the SMART software package
are also analyzed. It is worthy to note here that

the mid-infrared spectrum of ISO-Oph~102 shows crystalline

silicate features: enstatite (MgSiO_3) at 9.3~ and very strong

forsterite (Mg_2SiO_4) at 11.3~ (see Figure 4). The brown dwarf is indeed
an analog of SST-Lup3-1, which is an M5.5 brown dwarf in the Lupus III dark cloud .

The crystalline contribution to the silicate feature (flux at 11.3

over flux at 9.8 ) in ISO-Oph~102 is 1.1, even greater than

the value of 0.9 in SST-Lup3-1 .
This provides a direct evidence of grain growth and dust settling,

indicating the object is in the transition phase between

the class II and III (a class with an optically thin disk) and the brown

dwarf is reaching the final mass.

Summary

Here, we report the first confirmed detection of the bipolar molecular outflow

in young brown dwarfs. We characterize the fundamental properties

of the outflow with the first insight on its morphology.

The results indicate that the bipolar molecular outflow in brown dwarfs is very similar

to outflows as seen in young stars but scaled down by three and two

orders of magnitude for the outflow mass and the mass-loss rate, respectively.
We demonstrate for the first time that brown dwarfs,
even young planetary mass

objects can launch a
bipolar molecular outflow, and hence we confirm that they are likely to have
a common origin with the low-mass stars.
This suggests that the terminal stellar/brown dwarf mass
is not due to different formation mechanisms,
but more likely due to the initial mass of the cloud core.
We also show that there is evidence
for dust crystallization in the disk around the brown dwarf.
In brown dwarfs the molecular outflows may be longer lived than in low-mass
stars and they coexist with grain growth and crystallization.
Outflows from brown dwarfs may play a crucial role in sweeping out gas from
the disk and favouring the formation of rocky planets.
