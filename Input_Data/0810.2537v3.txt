abstract
Galaxies are believed to be in one-to-one correspondence with simulated dark
matter subhalos.
We use high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological volumes to calculate
the statistical properties of subhalo (galaxy) major mergers at high redshift
(z=0.6-5).
We measure the evolution of the galaxy merger rate, finding that it is much
shallower than the merger rate of dark matter host halos at z>2.5, but
roughly parallels that of halos at z<1.6.
We also track the detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure
the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo.
We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15\
merged galaxies are satellites and satellites are twice as likely as centrals
to have had a recent major merger.
Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of halos and
galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo,
noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at
z 2.5.

Introduction

Mergers are key in the hierarchical growth of structure, and major galaxy
mergers (referred to as mergers henceforth) are thought to play a crucial role
in galaxy evolution.
Specifically, they are expected to trigger quasar activity
[e.g.,][]Car90, starbursts [e.g.,][]BarHer91,Nog91, and
morphological changes [e.g.,][]TooToo72, and they are thought to be
related to Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), and
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
[see reviews by][respectively]Gia02,Bla02,SanMir96.
Observational samples of such objects at z 1 are now becoming large
enough to allow for statistical analyses of their counts [e.g.,][]Ste03,
Ouc04,Cop06,Yos06,Gaw07,Gen08,McL08,PatAtf08,Tac08,YamYagGot08.

Understanding galaxy mergers and their connection to these observables requires
comparison with theoretical predictions.
In simulations, galaxies are identified with subhalos, the substructures of
dark matter halos [e.g.][]Ghi98,Moo99,KlyGotKra99,Ghi00.
A subhalo can comprise an entire halo if there are no other subhalos within
the halo, see .
Simulations are now becoming sufficiently high in resolution and large in
volume to provide statistically significant samples [e.g.][]DeL04,Die04,
GaoWhiJen04,Ree05.
This high mass and force resolution is necessary to track bound subhalos
throughout their orbit in the host halo and avoid artificial numerical
disruption.
This is particularly important for tracking the orbits of galaxies, which are
expected to reside in the dense inner core of subhalos and to be more stable
to mass stripping than dark matter because of dissipative gas dynamics.
The correspondence of galaxies with subhalos has been successful in reproducing
galaxy counts and clustering in a wide array of measurements
[e.g.,][]Spr01,Spr05,ZenBerBul05,Bow06,ConWecKra06,ValOst06,WanKauDeL06.
Henceforth, we will use the term galaxy and subhalo interchangeably.

A subhalo forms when two halos collide and a remnant of the smaller halo
persists within the larger final halo.
Thus, subhalo merger rates are sometimes inferred from halo merger
rates
Halo merger counts and rates have been studied in a vast literature, both
estimated analytically [e.g.,][]KauWhi93,LacCol93,PerMil99,BenKamHas05,
ZhaFakMa08 and measured in simulations [e.g.,][]LacCol94,Tor98,Som00,
CohBagWhi01,GotKlyKra01,CohWhi05,Li07,CohWhi08,FakMa08,SteBulWec08.
or subhalo distributions, using a dynamical friction model to estimate the
infall time of satellite galaxies to their halo's central galaxy [several
of these methods are compared in][]HopHerCox08.
However, a detailed understanding of galaxy mergers requires a sufficiently
high-resolution simulation that can track the evolution and coalescence of
subhalos directly.

Here we use high resolution dark matter simulations to examine subhalo merger
rates, counts, and types, their mass and redshift dependence, and their
relation to their host halos.
Under the assumption that galaxies populate the centres of dark matter subhalo
potential wells, our subhalos are expected to harbor massive galaxies
(L L_*).
Although our subhalo mass assignment is motivated by semi-analytic arguments,
our results are independent of any specific semi-analytic modeling prescription.

Previous work on subhalo mergers includes both dark matter only simulations
and hydrodynamic
simulations .
Many of these earlier studies concern subhalo mergers within a single object
(such as the Milky Way or a galaxy cluster), others use lower resolution.
We look at relatively large simulation volumes (100 and 250 h^-1~Mpc boxes)
with high spatial and temporal resolution.
In addition, many previous works focus on subhalo mass loss and survival rate,
while our main interest here is the population of resulting merged subhalos
itself [most similar to the works of][]Mal06,GuoWhi08,Sim08,Ang08.
We characterize subhalo merger properties in detail, including satellite
mergers, at high redshift (z=0.6-5), during the peak of merger activity.
We also investigate the satellite halo occupation (number of satellites per
halo), and its evolution as shaped by the relative merger rates of subhalos and
halos.
The satellite halo occupation is a key element in the halo model , a framework which describes large-scale structure
in terms of host dark matter halos.

In we describe the simulations, our definitions of halos
and subhalos, their infall mass, and the evolution of the satellite fraction.
In we define our merger criteria and examine subhalo merger
rates and their relation to halo merger rates.
In we explore the relative contributions of satellites and
centrals to the merger population, both in terms of parents and merged children.
gives the distribution of the number of mergers within a
given look-back time and the fraction of halos that host subhalo mergers.
In we show how the difference in halo and subhalo merger
rates contributes to the evolution of the satellite halo occupation.
We summarize and discuss in .
The Appendices compare subhalo infall mass to infall maximum circular velocity
and its evolution with redshift, and give our satellite subhalo mass function.
The halo occupation and clustering of high redshift galaxy mergers is treated
in WetCohWhi09b.

Numerical Techniques

Simulations

We use two dark matter only N-body simulations of 800^3 and 1024^3
particles in a periodic cube with side lengths 100 h^-1~Mpc and
250 h^-1~Mpc, respectively.
For our cosmology ( _m=0.25, _ =0.75,
h=0.72, n=0.97 and _8=0.8), in agreement with a wide array of
observations , this results in particle masses of
1.4 10^8 h^-1M_ (1.1 10^9 h^-1M_ ) and a Plummer
equivalent smoothing of 4 h^-1~kpc (9 h^-1~kpc) for the smaller
(larger) simulation.
The initial conditions were generated at z=200 using the Zel'dovich
approximation applied to a regular Cartesian grid of particles and then evolved
using the TreePM\/ code described in TreePM [for a
comparison with other codes see][]Hei07,Evr08.
Outputs were spaced every 50~Myr ( 100~Myr) for the smaller (larger)
simulation, from z 5 to 2.5.
Additional outputs from the smaller simulation were retained at lower redshift,
spaced every 200~Myr down to z=0.6, below which we no longer fairly
sample a cosmological volume.
For mergers, we restrict these later outputs to z<1.6 based on convergence
tests of the merger rates (we lack sufficient output time resolution in the
intervening redshifts to properly catch all mergers; see end of
for more).
Our redshift range of z=0.6-5 allows us to examine subhalos across 7~Gyr of
evolution.

To find the subhalos from the phase space data we first generate a catalog of
halos using the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm with a linking
length of b = 0.168 times the mean inter-particle spacing.
This partitions the particles into equivalence classes by linking together all
particles separated by less than b, with a density of roughly
>3/(2 b^3) 100 times the background density.
The longer linking length of b=0.2 is often used.
However, this linking length is more susceptible to joining together distinct,
unbound structures and assigning a halo that transiently passes by another as
a subhalo.
Thus, we use a more conservative linking length, which for a given halo at our
mass and redshift regime yields a 15\
Many Millennium subhalo studies use Spherical Overdensity (SO) halos based on
an FoF(0.2) catalogue, in part to take out the extra structure joined by the
larger linking length.
Net07 compares the FoF(0.2) halo centres and those for the SO halos
used to define the corresponding subhalo populations.
More generally, Whi01 compares different mass definitions in detail,
and CohWhi08 discusses the relation of FoF(0.2), FoF(0.168), SO(180)
and Sheth-Tormen [][based on b=0.2]SheTor99b masses at high redshift.
We keep all FoF groups with more than 32 particles, and we refer to these
groups as ``(host) halos''.
Halo masses quoted below are these FoF masses.

When two halos merge, the smaller halo can retain its identity as a ``subhalo''
inside the larger host halo.
We identify subhalos (and sometimes subhalos within subhalos) using a new
implementation of the Subfind\/ algorithm .
We take subhalos to be gravitationally self-bound aggregations of particles
bounded by a density saddle point.
After experimentation with different techniques we find this method gives a
good match to what would be selected ``by eye'' as subhalos.
We use a spline kernel with 16 neighbours to estimate the density and keep
all subhalos with more than 20 particles.
The subhalo that contains the most mass in the halo is defined as the
central subhalo, all other subhalos in the same halo are satellites.
In most cases, the central subhalo in Subfind\/ is built around the most
bound and most dense particle in the group.
However, this is not always the case.
The central subhalo is also assigned all matter within the halo not assigned
to the satellite subhalos.
The position of a subhalo is given by the location of its most bound particle,
and the centre of a host halo is defined by the centre of its central subhalo.
For each subhalo we store a number of additional properties including the
bound mass, velocity dispersion, peak circular velocity, total potential
energy, and velocity.

Figure~ (top) shows the projected image of a sample halo
of mass 2.2 10^12 h^-1M_ , which hosts 12 satellite subhalos,
at z=2.6 in the 100 h^-1~Mpc simulation.
(At this redshift in our simulations there are approximately 200 halos per
(100 h^-1~Mpc)^3 above this mass.)
Halos at this mass and redshift regime are dynamically active and often highly
aspherical, with mean axial ratio (ratio of smallest-to-largest semi-major
axes) of 0.5, and recently merged halos have even more discrepant axial
ratios .
Figure~ also shows how a halo's densest region (figure
centre), centre of mass, and substructure distribution can all be offset from
one another.
Because of these asymmetries, satellite subhalos sometimes extend well beyond
r_200c, which we will call the halo virial radius.
The halo virial radius, r_200c, i.e. the radius within which the average
density is 200 the critical density, is calculated from the FoF
(b=0.168) mass by first converting to M_200c assuming a spherical NFW
density profile, and then taking
M_200c = 200 4 3 _c r^3_200c.

Subhalo Tracking

We identify, for each subhalo, a unique ``child'' at a later time, using
subhalo tracking similar to Spr05, Fal05, All05 and
Har06.
We detail our method to illustrate the subtleties which arise and to allow
comparison with other work.

We track histories over four consecutive simulation outputs at a time because
nearby subhalos can be difficult to distinguish and can ``disappear'' for a
few outputs until their orbits separate them again.
For each subhalo with mass M_1 at scale factor a_1, its child subhalo at a
later time (scale factor a_2 and mass M_2) is that which maximizes

= f (M_1,M_2 )
		 ^-1 ( a_2a_1 )
_i 2 _1i^2

where

f (M_1,M_2 ) =
cases
	1 - |M_1-M_2 |M_1+M_2 & M_1 < M_2
	1 & M_1 M_2
cases

and where _1i is the potential of particle i computed using all of
the particles in subhalo 1, and the sum is over those of the 20 most bound
particles in the progenitor that also lie in the candidate child.
We track using only the 20 most bound particles since our ultimate interest
is in galaxies, which we expect to reside in the highly bound, central region
of the subhalo (20 is the minimum particle count for our subhalos).
We do not use all the progenitor particles because summing over all of the
particles in the progenitor that also lie in the child candidate leads to
instances of parent-child assignment in which the child subhalo does not
contain the most bound particles of its parent.
Finally, we weight against large mass gains with a mass weighting factor so
that smaller subhalos passing through larger ones and emerging later on the
other side are correctly assigned as fly-by's and not mergers.
We find 95\
4\
identifiable child.

Figure~ (bottom) shows the tracking histories of the most
massive subhalos within the halo shown in Fig.~ (top), for
subhalos that had a mass >10^11 h^-1M_ when they fell into the halo.
The upper-most subhalo was a separate halo
(M=1.3 10^12 h^-1M_ ) hosting its own massive satellite subhalo.
It then fell into the main halo and then both (now satellite) subhalos merged
with each other.
The right-most subhalo is an example of two separate halos falling into the
main halo, becoming satellites, and subsequently merging with each other.
Finally, the track through the centre shows a single subhalo falling towards
the central subhalo.
Instead of merging with the central, it passes through as a fly-by.

All of these tracks show instances where the parent-child assignment algorithm
has skipped an output (dotted lines) as one subhalo passes through another and
re-emerges on the other side.
Note also that, while the dot-dashed circle shows the halo virial radius,
r_200c (at the last output), based on its mass assuming a spherical NFW
density profile, the locations of the transitions of central subhalos to
satellites during infall show that the spherical virial radius is only a rough
approximation.

As a halo falls into a larger host halo and becomes a satellite subhalo, mass
loss from tidal stripping can be extreme (90\
subhalo orbits towards the centre of its host halo.
Figure~ shows the evolution from infall of a long-lived
satellite with infall mass M_ inf = 6 10^11 h^-1M_ and
maximum circular velocity at infall of V_ c,inf = 258~km/s.
Mass and maximum circular velocity (V_ c,max^3) are stripped by
90\
After pericentric passage, a satellite can also gain mass and circular velocity
as it moves away from the dense centre of its host halo.
This is shown in Fig.~ where mass and circular velocity
strongly correlate with radial distance throughout the orbit.
This is partially an effect of our subhalo finder: the density contrast of a
subhalo, which defines its physical extent and hence its mass, drops as it moves
to a region of higher background density.
A fly-by, i.e. when a subhalo passes through and is temporarily
indistinguishable from a larger subhalo, is an extreme case of this.
However, this is also driven by a physical effect: as a satellite approaches
the dense centre of its host halo, it will be compressed by tidal shocks in
response to the rapidly increasing potential
[see Fig.~12 of][]DieKuhMad07,GneOst97,DekDevHet03.

Since a central subhalo is defined as the most massive subhalo, a satellite
subhalo can become a central (and vice versa), which we refer to as a
``switch''.
In more detail, a switch occurs when the density peak of a satellite (above the
background) contains more mass than is within the central subhalo's radius at
the position of the satellite.
We find that 4\
the same halo in the next output, and of these a third immediately return to
being centrals in the following output.
Switches are twice as common during a merger event, either when two satellites
merge, or when a satellite merges with the central, forming a less dense object
and allowing another satellite to bind more mass to itself.
When a satellite switches to a central and back to a satellite, the original
satellite can be mistakenly assigned as a direct parent of the final satellite
(and thus the central is assigned no parent) since our child assignment weights
against large mass gains (which occurs when a satellite becomes a central).
We fix these distinct cases by hand.

These switches highlight the fact that the distinction between a central and
satellite subhalo is often not clear-cut: at this redshift and mass regime
massive halos undergo rapid merger activity and thus often are highly disturbed
and aspherical, with no well-defined single peak that represents the center of
the halo profile.

Subhalo Mass Assignment

Since we use subhalos as proxies for galaxies, we track subhalo mass that
is expected to correlate with galaxy stellar mass.
Galaxies form at halo centres as baryons cool and adiabatically contract
toward the minimum of the halo's potential well, which leads to a correlation
between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass .
When a halo falls into a larger halo and becomes a satellite subhalo, its
outskirts are severely stripped as discussed above, but its galaxy's stellar
mass would be little influenced as the galactic radius is typically
10\
This motivates assigning to subhalos their mass at infall, M_ inf,
which is expected to correlate with galactic stellar mass throughout the
subhalo's lifetime.
The subhalo infall mass function has been successful at reproducing the
observed galaxy luminosity function and clustering at low redshifts
.
Maximum circular velocity at infall, V_ c,inf, has also been successfully
matched to some observations .
In Appendix A we show the relation between M_ inf and V_ c,inf and
its redshift evolution.

Our prescription for assigning M_ inf to subhalos is as follows.
When a halo falls into another and its central subhalo becomes a satellite
subhalo, the satellite is assigned M_ inf as the subhalo mass of its
(central) parent.
There is some dependence on output time spacing in this definition: since a
central subhalo typically continues to gain mass before it falls into a
larger halo, shorter time steps (which catch it closer to infall) lead to
a higher subsequent satellite M_ inf.
Doubling the output spacing leads to satellites with 10\
mass.
If a satellite merges with another satellite, the resultant child subhalo is
assigned the sum of its parents' M_ inf.
Since the central subhalo contains the densest region of a halo, inter-halo gas
is expected to accrete onto it, so we define M_ inf for a central subhalo
as its current self-bound subhalo mass, which is typically 90\
host halo's mass.
Though because of finite resolution, we find a weak systematic drop in
M_ cen/M_ halo with halo mass, varying from 93\
for 10^11 to 10^14 h^-1M_ in the higher resolution simulation.
However, since a central subhalo can switch to being a satellite, while a
satellite switches to being a central (all within a single host halo), we
require an additional rule because using the above simple assignment of
M_ inf to centrals would lead to a central and satellite in a halo each
having the halo's current bound mass.
Thus, we assign a central to have M_ inf as its current self-bound
subhalo mass only if it was the central in the same halo in the previous output.
Thus, if a satellite switches to a central and remains the central for multiple
outputs, it has robustly established itself as the central subhalo, so it is
assigned its current self-bound mass.
However, if a central was a satellite (or a central in another smaller halo)
in the previous output, it is assigned the sum of its parents' M_ inf,
with the additional requirement that its M_ inf cannot exceed its
current self-bound mass.

A small fraction ( 4\
particles are not easily identifiable with any progenitor subhalos and thus
cannot be tracked to infall.
On inspection, we find that these ``orphaned'' satellites are loosely
self-bound portions of a central subhalo, remnants from a collision between a
satellite and its central subhalo that soon re-merge with the central.
Given their origins and fates, these orphans are not expected to host galaxies
and are ignored.

Although we track subhalos down to 20 particles, we impose a much larger
minimum infall mass to our sample to avoid selecting subhalos that artificially
dissolve and merge with the central too early.
This requires sufficient resolution of the radial density profile of a
satellite subhalo at infall: if the satellite's core is smaller than a few
times the force softening length, its profile will be artificially shallow and
it will be stripped and disrupted prematurely (see Appendices for details).
For calibration, we use the regime of overlap in mass between our two
simulations of different mass resolution, requiring consistent subhalo mass
functions, halo occupation distributions, and merger statistics for a minimum
infall mass.
For example, going too low in mass for the larger simulation resulted in more
mergers and fewer satellites than for the same mass range in the smaller
simulation.
In the larger simulation, our consistency requirements led us to impose
M_ inf > 10^12 h^-1M_ .
For a fixed number of particles per subhalo, this scales down to
M_ inf > 10^11 h^-1M_ in the smaller, higher resolution
simulation.
Note that halos of mass 10^11~(10^12) h^-1M_ cross below M_*, the
characteristic mass of collapse, at z=1.5~(z=0.8), so we probe massive
subhalos across most of our redshift range.

At z=2.6, there are 16000 subhalos with
M_ inf > 10^11 h^-1M_ in our 100 h^-1~Mpc simulation and
9400 subhalos with M_ inf > 10^12 h^-1M_ in our
250 h^-1~Mpc simulation.
At z=1, there are 29400 (2500) subhalos with
M_ inf > 10^11~(10^12) h^-1M_ in our 100 h^-1~Mpc simulation.

A Note on Stellar Mass and Gas Content of Subhalo Galaxies

A galaxy's stellar mass is expected to be a non-linear, redshift-dependent
function of its subhalo mass.
An approximate relation based on abundance matching is given in
ConWec08.
At z=1, they find that subhalos of infall mass
10^11~(10^12) h^-1M_ host galaxies of stellar mass
10^9~(10^10.5) M_ .
At z=2.5, subhalos at the above masses are expected to host lower mass
galaxies, though quantitative relations at this redshift are less certain, and
our subhalo and halo finders differ in detail from theirs.
Our sample of M_ inf > 10^12 h^-1M_ subhalos approximately
corresponds to L L_* galaxies at the redshifts we examine.

Although our simulations do not track the baryonic content of subhalos, most
massive galaxies are gas-rich at high redshift.
That is, at z 1, 70\
observed to be blue , possessing enough gas to be actively
star forming.
The fraction of gas-rich galaxies at higher redshift is more poorly constrained
but is thought to be higher .
Thus, we anticipate that most, if not all, mergers we track have the capacity
to drive galaxy activity such as starbursts and quasars.

Satellite Fraction

To frame our ensuing discussion of mergers, and the relative importance of
satellite and central subhalos, Fig.~ shows the evolution of
the satellite fraction, n_ satellite/n_ subhalo, for subhalos of a
fixed mass
We show the satellite fraction for two mass bins, but since the mass function
falls exponentially at these masses and redshifts, almost all objects are
at the low end of the mass bin.
Using instead a minimum mass cut changes our results by only a few percent.,
which grows monotonically with time from z=5-0.6, as

n_ satelliten_ subhalo = C-e^- 1+z

with = 9.7 valid across all subhalo masses and C = 0.26~(0.24) for
lower (higher) mass.
The satellite fraction decreases with increasing subhalo mass since more
massive subhalos are more likely to be centrals, and for a fixed subhalo mass
the satellite fraction increases with time as the number of high mass halos
hosting massive satellites increases.
The increase in the satellite fraction is slowed at late times because the
number of massive satellites in halos of a fixed mass decreases with time as
the satellites coalesce with the central subhalo (see ).

Note that Eq.~ predicts a much higher satellite fraction than
that of ConWec08, who found

n_ satelliten_ subhalo = 0.2- 0.13z .

It is unlikely that the difference is driven by numerical effects, since both
their and our simulations are of similar mass resolution and volume, and both
analyses are based on similar subhalo infall mass cuts (we see similar satellite
fractions selecting instead on fixed V_ c,inf).
One likely factor is that, as noted above, our smaller output spacing yields
higher infall mass for satellite subhalos, since we catch halos closer to
infall when their mass is higher.
In addition, they use a different halo and subhalo finding algorithm
, and their higher _8 (0.9 rather
than our 0.8) would give a lower merger rate and thus fewer satellites (one
expects satellite survival timescales not to change).
If normalized to the same satellite fraction at a given epoch, the redshift
evolution of Eqs.~ and are in rough
agreement.

Merger Criteria and Rates

Merger Criteria

For two parents with M_ inf,2 M_ inf,1 sharing the same child
subhalo at the next output they appear, a child is flagged as a (major) merger
if M_ inf,2M_ inf,1 > 13.
If a child has more than two parents, we count multiple mergers if any other
parents also exceed the above mass ratio with respect to the most massive
parent.

Our mass ratio represents a trade-off between strong mergers (to maximize
signal) and frequent merging (for statistical power).
Galaxy mergers with stellar mass ratios closer than 3:1 are expected to drive
interesting activity, e.g. quasars and starbursts, as mentioned above.
Since galaxy stellar mass is a non-linear function of subhalo mass, a subhalo
mass ratio of 3:1 may correspond to a galaxy merger of a more or less
discrepant mass ratio.
However, since the M_ stellar-M_ subhalo relation is expected to
peak for M_ subhalo 10^12 h^-1M_ , we do
not expect this effect to strongly bias our results.

For generality, the distribution of merger (infall) mass ratios, R:1, for
both halos and subhalos in the mass and redshift regimes we consider can be
approximated by

f(R) R^-1.1

in reasonable agreement with the R^-1.2 distribution of galaxy mass ratios
at z<0.5 found in hydrodynamic simulations by Mal06.
The distribution of merger mass ratios also agrees well with the fit for halos
at z=0 provided by WetSchHol08.
Thus, the counts/rates of mergers with (infall) mass ratio closer than R:1 can
be approximately scaled from our results through the relation

N(<R) = 8.6 \, (R^0.1-1)N(<3) .

Sometimes merger criteria are based on instantaneous subhalo mass gain
[e.g.,][]ThaScaCou06.
However, as exemplified in Fig.~, subhalos can gain
significant mass without coalescence.
We find that most cases of significant subhalo mass gain are not a two-body
coalescence, and so we do not use this to select mergers (see
WetCohWhi09b for more detail, also related results in Mau07).

Sufficient output time resolution is necessary to properly resolve the merger
population.
Unless otherwise stated, we use the shortest simulation output spacing to
define the subhalo merger time interval, corresponding to 50~Myr
( 100~Myr) for M_ inf > 10^11~(10^12) h^-1M_
at z>2.5, and 200~Myr for all masses at z<1.6.
By tracking parent/child subhalo assignments across multiple output spacings,
we found that longer output time spacings result in a lower subhalo merger
rate, arising from a combination of effects.
As stated above, shorter time steps catch halos closer to their infall,
resulting in satellites with higher M_ inf, and hence more major
satellite-central mergers.
In addition, satellite-satellite mergers can be missed if their child merges
into the central subhalo before the next time step.
However, smaller output spacings are also more susceptible to switches, which
can yield satellites with higher mass.

For halos, very short time steps can artificially enhance the merger rate,
catching transient behavior as halos intersect, pass through each other, and
re-merge.
While we use FoF(0.168) instead of FoF(0.2) halos to help minimize artificial
bridging effects, for a 50~Myr time spacing halo re-mergers still constitute
a significant fraction of halo mergers.
Thus we calculate all our halo mergers using >100~Myr output spacings, for
which halo re-mergers constitute only a few percent of all mergers.

Given our simulation volumes we are unable to probe statistically significant
subhalo merger counts in halos more massive than
4 10^13 h^-1M_ at z>2.5 and M 10^14 h^-1M_
at z<1.6.
However, the majority of recently merged subhalos are centrals (discussed
below), and selecting on higher mass host halos for a fixed subhalo mass
restricts increasingly to recently merged satellites (of which there are
comparatively fewer).
Furthermore, nearly all subhalo mergers at a given mass occur in halos at most
5-10 times more massive.

Figure~ shows the evolution of the merger rate per
object---defined as the number of mergers per time per object---for both
subhalos and halos of the same (infall) mass.
Merger fraction errors are calculated using binomial statistics.
Given M mergers out of N objects, the mostly likely fraction is f = M/N
with variance _f^2 = M(N-M)+1+N(N+2)^2(N+3).
We fit the merger rate per object as

	 n_ mergen_ obj dt = A(1+z)^

where n_ merge is the number of (sub)halos whose parents match our mass
ratio selection, n_ obj is the total number of (sub)halos within the
same mass range at the same output, and dt it the time interval between
consecutive outputs.
The best-fit values in each redshift regime are shown in
Table~.
Note that the merger rate we examine is the number of mergers per time
per object, different from another common definition, the number of
mergers per time per volume.
The former is simply the latter divided by the number density of objects of the
same mass, but the merger rate per volume has qualitatively different behaviour
because the (comoving) number density of objects at a fixed mass increases with
time in a redshift-dependent manner.
Specifically, at high redshift where the mass function rapidly increases, the
merger rate per volume for both halos and subhalos increases with
time, reaching a peak at z 2.5.
Below this redshift, it decreases with time in a power law manner as in
Fig.~, though with a shallower slope of
1.5.

The relation of subhalo mergers to halo mergers is nontrivial.
Although subhalo mergers are the eventual result of halo mergers, the former
are governed by dynamics within a halo and the latter by large-scale
gravitational fields.
For halos, both the slope and the amplitude of the merger rate exhibit little
dependence on mass or redshift.
Similarly, e.g. FakMa08 found = 2-2.3 for all halo masses at
z<6, and weak halo mass dependence of the amplitude.
In contrast, the subhalo merger rate amplitude has strong dependence on mass
and its slope depends strongly on redshift.
Relative to the halo merger rate, the subhalo merger rate is lower in amplitude
than that of halos of the same (infall) mass, and, most notably at z>2.5, the
rate of subhalo mergers falls off significantly more slowly that that of halos.
This is consistent with earlier work: DeL04 found a higher merger
fraction for halos than subhalos, and GuoWhi08 found strong mass
dependence of the galaxy merger rate amplitude and that the slope becomes much
shallower at z>2 [see also][]Mat08.
(Note that as our halos are FoF(0.168) halos and so our merger rates can differ
from those for FoF(0.2) halos; merging occurs sooner for a finder with a larger
linking length.)

We now focus on the relation between halo and subhalo merger rates to
understand these trends with time.

Subhalo vs. Halo Merger Rates

A simple analytic argument based on dynamical infall time, i.e., subhalo
mergers are simply a delayed version halo mergers, leads one to expect that
subhalo merger rates simply track those of halos: they have the same time
evolution, with the subhalo merger rate having a higher amplitude.
In this argument, when two halos merge, the new satellite galaxy collides with
the other central galaxy within a dynamical friction timescale, approximated by

	t_ merge C_o M_ halo/M_ sat (1+M_ halo/M_ sat)t_ dyn

where t_ dyn = 0.1 t_ Hubble, t_ Hubble = 1H(z), and
C_o 1 accounts for the ensemble averaged satellite orbital parameters
.
Thus, for a fixed mass ratio, letting
m_o = M_ halo/M_ sat/ (1+M_ halo/M_ sat),

	t_ sat,merge 0.1 \, C_o m_o t_ Hubble 0.1 \, C_o m_o t .

The evolution of the halo merger rate per object during matter-domination
(valid at the high redshifts we examine), where a t^2/3, is
approximately

	 n_ mergen_ halo dt = A(1+z)^ = ( tt_* )^- 23 ,

with t_* some proportionality constant.
Assuming all halo mergers lead to satellite-central subhalo mergers on a
dynamical friction timescale, the subhalo merger rate per object would evolve
with time as

n_ mergen_ subhalodt &= ( t-t_ sat,merget_* )^- 23
&= (1-0.1 \, C_om_o)^- 23 ( tt_* )^- 23

and so the subhalo merger rate would simply track that of halos of the same
mass, but with higher amplitude.

Resolving the Discrepancy

As Fig.~ shows, however, this tracking does not occur,
particularly at high redshift where the slope of the subhalo merger rates is
much shallower than that of halos.
One reason for this is that we compute the merger rate per object, in which we
divide by the number of objects at the given mass, n_ obj(m).
Since halo masses are added instantaneously during halo mergers, a recently
merged halo will instantly jump to a higher mass regime (with smaller
n_ obj in Eq.~).
In contrast, the central subhalo of the resultant halo will remain at a smaller
mass for some time until its mass grows from stripping of the new satellite
subhalo (i.e., recently merged halos have lower than average
M_ inf,cen/M_ halo), so the central's n_ obj is higher.

In Fig.~ (left) the dotted black curve fits the halo merger
rate for halos selected with the same mass cut on their central subhalo infall
mass.
The amplitude is significantly smaller, and the slope is also shallower
( = 1.6) than for halos selected on full halo mass, showing that the
above effect is stronger at earlier times.
By the argument above, the ratio of amplitudes of the merger rate per object of
halos to subhalos is n_ halo/n_ cen.
A fixed (sub)halo mass cut probes lower M/M_*(t) at later times, and the mass
function drops exponentially with increasing M/M_*(t) at these masses.
Thus, a fixed M_ inf,cen/M_ halo after a halo merger means
n_ halo/n_ cen becomes closer to unity at later times, leading to
the shallower slope.

The measured subhalo mergers have an even lower amplitude and shallower slope
than the dotted line in Fig.~, driven by two additional
effects.
First, a halo major merger might not lead to a subhalo major merger since the
satellite-central merger mass ratio can be smaller than the mass ratios of
their source halos.
This is because M_ inf naturally grows for a central but only grows for
a satellite if it has a merger before coalescing with the central
[see][for a detailed analysis of this effect in terms of assigning
baryons to subhalos]WanKau08.
Since halos grow in mass more quickly at higher redshift, this effect is
stronger at earlier times, further flattening the subhalo merger rate slope.
Second, there is a significant contribution of recently merged satellites to
the merger population.
We find that satellites are twice as likely to have had a recent merger as
centrals of the same mass, regardless of mass cut and redshift (see
for more detail).
This enhances the merger rate, with a stronger enhancement at later times
since the satellite fraction grows with time as in Fig.~.

At lower redshift, Fig.~ (right) shows that the amplitude
of the subhalo merger rate remains lower than that of halos, but the slopes
become similar, indicating the effects examined above become less
time-dependent.
Since the masses we probe are crossing M_*(t) as these redshifts, the reduced
amplitude from subhalo vs. halo mass cut becomes less sensitive to time.
Similarly, our mass range crossing M_*(t) means that halo mass growth slows,
so the fraction of halo major mergers that leads to subhalo major mergers
remains roughly constant with time.
Finally, as shown in Fig.~, the satellite fraction growth
asymptotes at lower redshift, which means that the enhancement from recently
merged satellites remains roughly constant.

figure*

The stereotypical galaxy merger is a satellite coalescing with the central in
its halo and producing a central merger remnant.
These mergers do dominate the merger population, both in parent types
(central-satellite) and child type (central).
However, while satellites form the minority of the subhalo population at all
epochs (see Fig.~), satellites are twice as likely to have had
a recent merger as centrals of the same mass, regardless of mass and redshift.

Since the identities of satellite vs. central subhalos at this mass and
redshift regime are not clear-cut (from switches), we characterize mergers both
in terms of their parent types (central/satellite) and resulting child types.
For mergers resulting in centrals, this ambiguity is not important:
97\
satellite-satellite parents during switches.
A few percent arise from central-central parents, when the central regions of
two halos coalesce so quickly that they are not seen as satellite-central
subhalos given finite time resolution.
We include these as satellite-central parents.

Recently merged satellites are a more varied population.
Figure~ shows the contributions of satellite mergers to
the overall merger populations as a function of the scale factor.
Satellite merger fractions are boxcar-averaged across three consecutive outputs
to reduce noise from small number statistics.
The fraction of all subhalo mergers that result in a satellite is 30\

redshift.
For M_ inf=10^12-10^13 h^-1M_ it is 15-20\

merger occurs in a halo as it falls into a larger halo, becoming a satellite.
The rest arise from switches, i.e. a satellite merges with a central, and the
resulting subhalo no longer is the most massive subhalo, thus becoming a
satellite.
These switches occur primarily in halos only a few times more massive than the
satellite, typically for satellites in close proximity to their central.
At higher halo masses, recently merged satellites are dominated by
satellite-satellite parents.
These satellite-satellite mergers preferentially occur in the outer regions of
a halo and are comparatively less common in the central regions.
We examine in more detail the environmental dependence of subhalo mergers in

Galaxy and Halo Merger Counts

Counts of Recent Mergers

The distribution of the number of mergers per object within a fixed time
interval gives the fraction of objects at a given epoch that might exhibit
merger-related activity or morphological disturbance.
This differs from the merger rates of , since we are tracking
the histories of individual objects selected at a given redshift.
Multiple mergers as well might contribute to specific properties, e.g., the
formation and mass growth of elliptical galaxies [e.g.,][]BoyMaQua05,
Rob06,NaaKhoBur06,ConHoWhi07.

Figure~ shows the fraction of subhalos at z=2.6 and z=1
with a given number of mergers in the last 1~Gyr.
At z=2.6, 30\
Interestingly, this fraction is nearly constant across the mass regimes we
probe.
In contrast, the fraction of halos with at least one major merger within
1~Gyr is about twice as large, with stronger mass dependence: higher mass
halos experience more mergers.
At high redshift, halos are also significantly more likely to have undergone
multiple mergers than subhalos, which builds up the satellite population.

At z=1, recent mergers of subhalos and halos become less common, with only
8\
Objects which have had 1 or 2 mergers are still more common for halos than
subhalos, though high mass subhalos exhibit a much higher fraction of 3 or more
mergers than halos of the same (infall) mass.
(Subhalos that have undergone 1 merger can be either satellites or centrals,
those that have undergone 2 or more mergers are almost entirely centrals.)
The build-up of the satellite population at higher redshift has allowed massive
centrals to experience multiple mergers at lower redshift.
This effect is stronger for more massive subhalos since they are more likely
to be centrals, and they reside in higher mass halos with more massive
satellites.

figure*

The fraction of halos that host recent mergers, f_ on, is of particular
interest for quasar or starburst evolution models, and quasar/starburst
feedback effects such as heating of the Intracluster Medium (ICM).
We select mergers up to 200~Myr after coalescence, motivated by the expected
time interval during which quasars or starbursts remain observable
[e.g.,][]HopHerCox05.
This time interval is only illustrative, though, as one expects relevant
lifetimes to depend strongly upon galaxy mass and merger ratio.
Observables might depend upon dynamical time as well, although many quasar
triggering effects might be related to microphysics--small scale interactions
close to the merger--that do not evolve with time.
If we scale our f_ on time interval by the dynamical time, the slope of
f_ on becomes slightly shallower, but the qualitative results do not
change.

Figure~ shows the evolution of f_ on for halos hosting
subhalo mergers within the last 200~Myr.
The same quantity is shown for halos with recent mergers themselves.
At high redshift, f_ on for halo mergers shows a steep decline from the
decreasing halo merger rate.
However, f_ on for subhalo-subhalo mergers is flat from z=2.5-5,
because the subhalo merger rate per object decreases while the number of
massive satellites in a given mass halo rises, causing the number of massive
subhalo mergers within the halo to remain constant.
At low redshift, where the satellite population grows more slowly, the
evolution of this fraction for subhalo mergers more closely parallels that of
halo mergers.

Evolution of the Satellite Halo Occupation

The redshift evolution of the satellite galaxy populations of dark matter halos
is shaped by halo vs. galaxy mergers: halo mergers create satellites while
galaxy mergers remove them.
Though if one applies a mass threshold to a population, this is not strictly
true since mergers also scatter lower mass objects into the population.
If the infall rate of satellites onto a halo is different than the satellite
destruction rate, the satellite halo occupation will evolve with time.

As shown in Fig.~, at z>2.5, the merger rate of subhalos
is significantly lower and shallower in slope than that of halos, implying that
subhalos are being created faster than they are destroyed (at a rate decreasing
with time).
Conversely, at z<1.6 the merger rates of halos and subhalos exhibit
approximately the same redshift dependence, and their amplitudes are similar
(also recall from that not all halo major merger lead to
subhalo major mergers).
Thus, for halos of a fixed mass, we expect a rapid rise in the satellite halo
occupation prior to z 2 and a levelling-off with more gradual evolution
at lower redshift.

Satellite Halo Occupation in Simulation

The above trends are seen in Fig.~, which shows the evolution
of the satellite occupation per halo, for satellites with
M_ inf > 10^11 h^-1M_ in the 100 h^-1~Mpc simulation.
Satellite occupation counts are normalized using the last output at z=0.6.
More massive satellites (M_ inf > 10^12 h^-1M_ ) have similar
evolution, with a peak in the satellite halo occupation at z 2.5.
For a fixed satellite infall mass, less massive halos exhibit stronger
satellite occupation evolution with redshift, leading to a more prominent peak.

Analytic Estimate of Satellite Halo Occupation

The rate of change of the satellite subhalo population per halo, for a fixed
satellite M_ inf, is given by the rate at which satellites fall into a
halo (the halo merger rate) minus the rate at which satellites coalesce with
the central subhalo

dN_ satdt = dN_ halo,mergedt- dN_ sat-cen,mergedt .

The halo merger rate at all epochs is given by ( )

dN_ halo,mergedt = A(1+z)^ = Aa^-

The timescale for the satellite to coalesce with its central subhalo after
infall is given to good approximation by

t_ sat-cen,merge C_o10 M_ halo/M_ sat (1+M_ halo/M_ sat)t_ Hubble .

where C_o is a constant of order unity that accounts for the ensemble
averaged satellite orbital parameters, and we leave it as our sole free
parameter.
The rate of satellite destruction/coalescence is thus

dN_ sat-cen,mergedt = 10C_o (1+M_ halo/M_ sat)M_ halo/M_ satH(z) .

Combining Eqs.~ and into
Eq.~ one gets

dN_ satdt = Aa^- - 10C_o (1+M_ halo/M_ sat)M_ halo/M_ satH(z) .

At high redshift, H(z) H_o( _ m,oa^-3)^ 12,
where H_o 0.1 h~Gyr^-1, which implies

dN_ satdt Aa^- - 1C_o (1+M_ halo/M_ sat)M_ halo/M_ sat _ m,o^ 12a^- 32 .

Across all mass and redshift regimes, the power law index for halo mergers is
= 2-2.3 ( ), and we find no additional dependence on
merger mass ratio, suggesting a universal power law index.
Though merger rates for more discrepant mass ratios have higher amplitudes, as
given by Eq.~.
Thus, the creation and destruction terms in Eq.~ have
differing dependencies on the scale factor, which implies they become equal at
some redshift, where the satellite occupation per halo reaches a maximum.

Using the exact evolution of the Hubble parameter (in our cosmology) of
H(z) = H_o( _ m,oa^-3+ _ )^1/2 in
Eq.~, and integrating over a, the full evolution of the
satellite occupation per halo is

N_ sat(a) & = AH_o da a^-( +1)H(z)
& - 10C_o M_ satM_ halo (1+ M_ haloM_ sat ) (a)+K

where the constant K accounts for initial/final conditions.
Figure~ shows the resultant N_ sat(a), normalized to
the satellite occupation per halo at final output, using typical values for the
halo merger rate from Table~ (A=0.032 and = 2.3).
These values correspond to 3:1 mass ratio mergers, for satellites with
M_ inf = 10^11 h^-1M_ this gives
M_ halo = 3 10^11 h^-1M_ .
While the fit of this model to the simulation results is not exact, it nicely
reproduces the general trends, especially given the simplicity of the model,
which ignores halo/central mass growth, satellite-satellite mergers, and
switches.
For instance, it correctly produces a lower peak in satellite occupation for
halos with satellites of more discrepant mass ratios (more massive halos for a
fixed satellite mass, or less massive satellites for a fixed halo mass),
relative to the amplitude at low redshift.
This is because the decreased infall times for smaller satellite-halo mass
ratios cause a more dramatic fall (after the peak) in the satellite population
for lower mass halos.

Agreement of this model with our simulations also requires C_o 2,
which can be compared with other work.
ZenBerBul05 and Jia08 find that the ensemble averaged
satellite orbital circularity distribution is given by
= 0.5 0.2, with no strong dependence on redshift
or satellite-halo mass ratio.
When applied to detailed dynamical friction timescale fits from simulation,
this yields C_o 0.6 and
C_o 1.4 .
The C_o values of these two fits agree only in extreme cases, i.e. maximally
circular orbits for BoyMaQua08 or maximally eccentric orbits for
.
Taken at face value, our even higher value of C_o means that our satellites
are taking longer to merge, suggesting that the discrepancy does not arise from
artificial over-merging in our simulations.
However, exact comparisons are difficult given the simple nature of our analytic
model, and because both of these groups use different halo and subhalo finding
algorithms.
Jia08, who used a simulation of roughly similar volume and mass
resolution to ours, also incorporated hydrodynamics, which is likely to shorten
the merger timescale since it introduces further dissipational effects to the
subhalo orbits and reduces mass loss.
Compared with BoyMaQua08, who performed much higher resolution
simulations of isolated halo mergers, it is possible that our satellite
subhalos experience more severe mass stripping upon infall, decreasing their
mass and thus extending their subsequent infall time (see Eq.~).
A more detailed investigation of satellite infall timescales in a cosmological
setting is needed, studies now in progress are targeting in particular the role
of hydrodynamic effects .

Comparison to Other Work on Satellite Occupation Evolution

Figure~ shows a peak in the number of satellites per halo at
z 2.5.
Fundamentally, the reason for this peak is that we select subhalos of
fixed minimum infall mass in halos of fixed mass
across time.
If instead we examine the satellite occupation for halos above a minimum mass
cut, the growth of massive halos (hosting more satellites) at late time would
overwhelm the drop in the satellite population at a fixed halo mass, so the
satellite halo occupation would grow monotonically and appear much like the
satellite fraction in Fig.~, which ignores halo mass.
Though the satellite halo occupation would have a higher amplitude since it
measures n_ sat/n_ central while the satellite fraction measures
n_ sat/n_ subhalo = n_ sat/(n_ central+n_ sat).

These results agree with the interpretation that more massive halos have later
formation times and longer satellite infall times, and thus host more
substructure at a given epoch .
Similarly, for a fixed satellite infall mass, the satellite halo occupation
evolves more rapidly for less massive halos, as ZenBerBul05 and
DieKuhMad07 found, though their results were based upon subhalo
instantaneous mass and maximum circular velocity (we compare these to
M_ inf in the Appendices).

However, the peak in satellite halo occupation in Fig.~ does
not appear in Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) evolution studies by
ZenBerBul05 because they use a fixed cut on instantaneous maximum
circular velocity across time.
As shown in Appendix A, fixed V_ c,max probes lower mass at higher
redshift, and this evolution in satellite mass overwhelms the satellite
evolution of Fig.~, leading to a monotonic rise in the
satellite halo occupation with redshift.
Similarly, ConWecKra06 noted that the HOD shoulder (the halo mass where
a halo hosts only a central galaxy) becomes shorter at higher redshift as an
increasing fraction of low-mass halos host more than one galaxy, finding a
monotonically increasing satellite population with redshift.
However, they compare fixed satellite number density (not mass) across
redshift, which corresponds to a lower subhalo mass at higher redshift.
Again, this overwhelms the evolution of Fig.~, leading to a
monotonic rise in the satellite population per halo with redshift.

In their semi-analytic model matched to simulation, vdBTorGio05 find
that the average subhalo mass fraction of a halo always decreases with time,
and they claim that, as a result, the timescale for subhalo mass loss
(approximately the dynamical/infall time) is always smaller than the timescale
of halo mass accretion (mergers).
This implies that the satellite infall rate is always higher than the halo
merger rate, and so the satellite HOD always decreases with time.
However, this result refers to the total subhalo instantaneous mass per halo,
not galaxy counts based on infall mass.
If instead we examine the evolution of the satellite occupation per halo as in
Fig.~ selecting the satellites based on instantaneous
subhalo mass instead of infall mass, we find a monotonic increase in the
satellite occupation with no peak, in agreement with other authors above.

These examples all illustrate how the evolution of the HOD is dependent both
on satellite mass assignment and selection of fixed mass vs. circular velocity
vs. number density across time.

Summary and Discussion

Using high-resolution dark matter simulations in cosmological volumes, we have
measured the rates, counts, and types of subhalo (galaxy) major mergers at
redshift z=0.6-5, describing their populations in terms of
centrals/satellites and contrasting their merger properties with those of
halos of the same (infall) mass.
We assign subhalos their mass at infall (with the capacity for mass growth
during satellite mergers), motivated by an expected correlation with galaxy
stellar mass, but include no further semi-analytic galaxy modelling.
We select mergers requiring 3:1 or closer infall mass ratios, motivated by the
expectation that these can trigger activity such as quasars, starbursts, and
related objects such as Lyman break galaxies, submillimeter galaxies, and
ULIRGs.
We highlight our main results as follows:

itemize
The merger rate per object of subhalos is always lower than that of halos
of the same (infall) mass.
Galaxies exhibit stronger mass dependence on the amplitude of their merger
rate than halos, with more massive galaxies undergoing more mergers.
While the slope of the halo merger rate per object is essentially redshift
independent, the slope of the galaxy merger rate is much shallower than that of
halos at z>2.5 and parallels that of halos at z<1.6.
These differences in halos and subhalo merger rates arise because (1)
halo mergers add mass to halos instantly, while central subhalo mass grows more
gradually after a halo merger; (2) halo major mergers do not necessarily lead
to subhalo major mergers, since central subhalos experience mass growth while a
satellite subhalo's infall mass typically remains constant as it orbits; and
(3) the satellite subhalo fraction grows with time, and satellites are twice as
likely to be recent mergers as centrals of the same infall mass.
15\
significant fraction of these arise from satellite-central parents during
switches.
5\
higher fraction at lower redshift.
At z=2.6~(z=1), 30\
one major merger in the last 1~Gyr, regardless of mass.
Halos are more likely to have experience multiple mergers in their recent
history.
The likelihood of a halo to host a recently merged galaxy, f_ on,
does not evolve with time at z>2.5 and falls with time at z<1.6.
Comparing galaxy and halo merger rates allows one to understand the
evolution of the satellite halo occupation, and we approximated this behaviour
analytically including fits to our simulations.
Selecting subhalos on fixed infall mass, the satellite halo occupation for
halos of a fixed mass increases with time at high redshift, peaks at
z 2.5, and falls with time after that.
This implies similar evolution for the satellite galaxy component of the Halo
Occupation Distribution.

Our results, based entirely on the dynamics of dark matter, represent an
important but preliminary step towards quantifying the nature of galaxy mergers
in hierarchical structure formation.
To compare to many observables we would need to include baryonic effects, and
indeed such effects can provide corrections to the merger rates themselves
.
The merger rates here also do not include whether the subhalos are gas-rich
(required for some observables) or not, though at the high redshifts we
examine, we expect almost all galaxies to be gas-rich.
While satellites can be stripped of much of their gas before merging with their
central [e.g.,][]Dol08,Sar08, we have considered primarily massive
satellites (relative to their host halos), which have short infall times and
thus experience less gas stripping.

Timescales between observables and our measured merger event also play a role.
In simulations, a quasar can appear up to 1~Gyr after galaxy
coalescence, though starbursts may occur more quickly
[e.g.,][]HopHerCox05,SprDiMHer05b,Cox08.
However, morphological disturbance is clearest during first passage and final
coalescence .
The time scales for each signature to commence and/or persist also have a large
scatter, ranging from 0.2 to 1.2~Gyr after the merger.
Finally, specific observations will also have specific selection functions.
The quantitative measurements provided here provide starting points for these
analyses in addition to helping to understand the properties of galaxies and
their mergers in general.

Unfortunately, our predictions are not easily compared to observations which
estimate merger rates at z 1 using close galaxy pairs or disturbed
morphologies [most recently,][]Bel06,Kam07,Kar07,Lin08,LotDavFab08,McI08,
PatAtf08 since they have found that the close pair fraction evolves as
(1+z)^ with a diverse range of exponents from =0 to 4.
Furthermore, translating these observations into galaxy or halo merger rates
requires including more physical effects, e.g. time dependent galaxy
coalescence timescales or inclusion of changes in
numbers of host halos with redshift .

While we were preparing this work for preparation, Sim08 appeared which
considers detailed merger properties of satellite subhalos in a hydrodynamic
simulation, and Ang08 appeared which considers satellite mergers in the

Subhalo Mass and Circular Velocity

Here we further elaborate on the details of subhalos in our simulations,
including their radial density and circular velocity profiles and the relation
between mass and maximal circular velocity, including its evolution with time.

Figure~ shows the radial density and circular
velocity profiles for 8 satellite and 8 central subhalos with
V_ c,max 250~km/s (M 10^12 h^-1M_ ) at z=2.6 in
the 100 h^-1~Mpc simulation.
Circular velocity is defined as V_c GM(<r)/r, and since
subhalos follow NFW density profiles, with a break in the power-law density
profile at the scale radius, r_s, they have a maximum value in their circular
velocity profiles, V_ c,max, at r_ max = 2.2r_s.
The left panels show the radial profiles of all matter surrounding the
subhalos, while the right panels show only that of matter assigned to the
subhalos.
Satellites and centrals have similar profiles at small radii, though the right
top panel shows that satellites exhibit signs of tidal truncation at
50 h^-1~kpc.
This is also visible in the circular velocity profile in the bottom left panel,
where V_c for satellites rises sharply, exhibiting a transition to their host
halos.
For the centrals, the rise in V_c beyond 1 h^-1~Mpc arises from
neighbouring structures.

Figure~ shows the relation between subhalo infall mass,
M_ inf, and infall maximum circular velocity, V_ c,inf, for
subhalos at z=2.6.
We fit this relation to

V_ c,inf^ = B(z) M_ inf

for all subhalos above 10^11 h^-1M_ , finding = 3 holds to
good approximation at all redshifts we examine, in agreement with the virial
relation V_ c,max^2 M/R M/M^1/3 M^2/3.
The outliers with large M_ inf relative to V_ c,inf are
satellites that experienced a major merger; under our prescription, a satellite
child's M_ inf is the sum of its parents' M_ inf, but a
child's V_ c,inf is that of its highest V_ c,inf parent.

Fixing = 3, Fig.~ shows the evolution of the
amplitude B(z) V_ c,inf^3/M_ inf.
A subhalo of a given mass has a higher maximum circular velocity at higher
redshift, reflective of the increased density of the universe when the subhalo
formed.
As a subhalo subsequently accretes mass, its V_ c.max^3 grows more slowly
than it mass (in cases of slow mass growth, we find V_ c.max^3 can remain
constant).
This is in agreement with DieKuhMad07, who found that halos undergoing
mild mass growth (no major mergers) had less than 10\
V_ c,max and r_ max.
We find that the evolution of B(z) (within the redshifts we probe) can be
well-approximated by

B(z) = 6.56 10^-6 e^0.36z ( km/s)^3 h M_ ^-1 .

Thus, M_ inf = 10^11~(10^12) h^-1M_ subhalos correspond to
V_ c,inf 120~(250)~km/s at z=2.6 and
V_ c,inf 100~(200)~km/s at z=1.
Conversely, for fixed V_ c,inf, a subhalo is about half as massive at
z=2.6 than at z=1.

Since we fit relations of satellite subhalo properties at infall, our results
above are applicable equally to satellite and central subhalos.
In addition, our results change by only a few percent if we instead consider
host halos.

Satellite Subhalo Mass Function

Figure~ shows the satellite subhalo (scaled) mass
function vs. the ratio of satellite mass to halo mass, for various host halo
mass bins at z=1.
Thick curves show satellite masses selected on M_ inf, while thin curves
show satellite masses selected on instantaneous bound mass.
The rollover in the M_ inf curves at low satellite mass indicates where
satellites become numerically disrupted by resolution effects.
Numerical disruption occurs at higher satellite M_ inf for more massive
halos, indicating that satellites of a fixed M_ inf experience more
pronounced tidal stripping in higher mass halos, where dynamical friction
timescales and central densities are higher.
The rollover in the highest halo mass bin occurs at
M_ sat,inf 10^11 h^-1M_ , which sets our minimum subhalo
mass for robust tracking.

We find that the scaled instantaneous bound mass function exhibits little-to-no
systematic dependence on halo mass, in agreement with Ang08.
We thank the referee for suggesting we show this quantity.
This is in contrast to the scaled infall mass function, which shows more
satellites at a given mass ratio for more massive halos.
This difference is driven by subhalo mass stripping.
Averaged over the entire satellite population at this redshift, the satellite
instantaneous bound mass is 30\
the x-axis offset of the solid and dashed curves.
However, satellites exhibit less average mass loss in low-mass halos than
high-mass halos, the instantaneous to infall mass ratios being 40\
25\
This is considerably higher than the 5\
semi-analytic model of vdBTorGio05.
Additionally vdBTorGio05 and GioTorvdB08 found the opposite
trend with halo mass, i.e., that the average mass loss of satellites is higher
for lower mass halos.
They find that this arises because lower mass halos form (and accrete their
subhalos) earlier, when the dynamical/stripping timescale is shorter.
Thus, the satellites of lower mass halo are stripped both more rapidly and over
a longer time period [see also][]ZenBerBul05.
Finally, GioTorvdB08 find that the scaled mass functions of subhalos at
infall does not depend on halo mass, in seeming contrast with
Fig.~.

These discrepancies likely arises because we examine the masses of extant
subhalos in our simulation, while vdBTorGio05 and GioTorvdB08
track subhalo mass loss much longer than our simulation does.
Their semi-analytical model of subhalo mass loss has no prescription for
central-satellite mergers, which preferentially serve to reduce highly stripped
satellites from our sample.
See TayBab05 and ZenBerBul05 for detailed comparisons of
simulated subhalos with analytic models.
Since satellites of a given infall mass to halo mass ratio have lower mass in
lower mass halos, they are closer to our minimum subhalo finding mass threshold.
Thus, a fixed amount of stripping will cause lower mass halos to have a reduced
population of satellites of a given infall mass to halo mass ratio.
It is unclear at what level of subhalo mass stripping we should expect the
galaxies they host to become disrupted as well.

Various studies using high resolution simulations have explored in detail the
slope of the subhalo mass function , finding that the (instantaneous) mass function of subhalos
goes as N_ sat(>M_ sat) (M_ halo/M_ sat)^ ,
with = 0.9-1.
N_ sat(>M_ sat) has the same power law dependence on subhalo mass
as dN_ satd (M_ sat/M_ halo)).
We note, though, that these fits are based on cuts on instantaneous subhalo
mass or circular velocity, not those at infall.
However, we find that, between the rollover in M_ inf at low and high
satellite mass, the slopes of the mass functions selected on infall and
instantaneous bound mass are the same within error, and = 0.9$ fits our
mass function selected on either mass.
The similarity of the two slopes also implies that the mass loss rate of
satellites does not depend strongly on satellite mass, in agreement with
GioTorvdB08.
