As demonstrated in there is a universal relation for the
maximal electric charge of any spherical object with radius
R m_e^-1 4 10^2 fm,

Z_ (R) 2m_eR/ =0.71R_fm,

where Z_ is the maximal charge possible with infinite time available
for electron-positron pair creation in a supercritical field, m_e is the
electron mass, is the fine structure constant, and
R_fm is the radius in fm. For R m_e^-1 there is a
smooth transition (denoted Z^Mads(R) in )
from the object-specific core charge without
electrons, Z_core(R), to the universal asymptotic
relation Z_ (R).
The universal
relation changes for R 25m_e^-1 10^4 fm into Z(R)
11.2m_e^2R^2=7 10^-5R_fm^2, if only a finite time is
available for pair creation .

The authors of consider only the infinite-time case. They argue
that Z^Mads(R) is only one of two possible boundaries in the
charge-radius plane that act as attractors of charged objects, the other being
the threshold charge Z_thr^(1)(R) where the electric charge is
just sufficient for the first possible pair creation to take place. The
charge-radius plane should then be divided into three regimes.
(i) Z_core
(R)>Z^Mads(R), where pair creation saturates the Pauli principle
with electrons partly shielding the core charge and reducing the net charge of
the sphere to Z^Mads(R) as found in ;
(ii) Z_thr^(1)(R)<Z_core(R)<Z^Mads(R)
, where the body creates pairs till the net
charge diminishes down to Z_thr^(1)(R)
;
(iii) Z_thr^(1)(R)>Z_core(R), where no pair creation
takes place. Ref.~ calculates Z_thr^(n)(R), where n
enumerates s-wave solutions that dive into the negative energy continuum below
-m_e, by solving the single particle Dirac equation in a large radius
approximation for a spherical shell core potential
and finds that Z_thr^(n)(R) Z_ (R)
for R . This asymptotic behavior
was previously demonstrated for s- and p-waves for a
shell core charge in and there taken to confirm the universal
relation of .

The idea
that Z_thr^(1)(R) should act as an attractor in
the charge-radius plane is based on a misinterpretation of the solutions to
the Dirac equation diving into the negative energy continuum
below -m_e. In particular, Eqs.~(1) and (2) in are not
applicable to the self-consistent problem considered in
since the screening
charge from the electrons formed is not included. A detailed discussion of the
underlying physics is given in . When Z_thr
^(2)(R)>Z_core(R)>Z_thr^(1)(R) ((1) and (2)
denote the two lowest-lying solutions found in
, not the s-waves from ) only the 1s_1/2-state
is diving into the negative energy continuum. This shields the core charge by
two units. For Z_thr^(3)(R)>Z_core(R)>Z_thr
^(2)(R) additional screening by p_1/2 electrons becomes available,
etc. As the number of electrons increases, one must
self-consistently include their charge ,
. For Z_core(R)>Z^Mads(R) all available
Fermi levels are filled and the relation of is followed by any
sphere with Z_core(R)>Z^Mads(R). All objects with
Z^Mads(R)>Z_core(R)>Z_thr^(1)(R)
are partly screened, and a self-consistent analysis could
map out a sequence of Z(R) curves populated in steady state. Contrary to
the claim of , Z_thr^(1)(R) does not act like an
attractor but marks the onset of pair production.
