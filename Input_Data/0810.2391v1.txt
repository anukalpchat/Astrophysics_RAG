We estimate a characteristic timescale for star formation in the spiral arms
of disk galaxies, going from atomic hydrogen ( ) to dust-enshrouded
massive stars. Drawing on high-resolution \ data from The \ Nearby
Galaxy Survey and 24~ images from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey we measure the average angular offset between the \ and
24 emissivity peaks as a function of radius, for a sample of 14 nearby
disk galaxies. We model these offsets assuming an instantaneous kinematic
pattern speed, _p, and a timescale, , for the characteristic
time span between the dense \ phase and the formation of massive stars
that heat the surrounding dust. Fitting for _p and , we find
that the radial dependence of the observed angular offset (of the \ and
24~ emission) is consistent with this simple prescription; the
resulting corotation radii of the spiral patterns are typically R_
cor 2.7 R_s, consistent with independent estimates. The
resulting values of \ for the sample are in the range 1--4 Myr. We have
explored the possible impact of non-circular gas motions on the estimate of
\ and have found it to be substantially less than a factor of 2. This
implies that a short timescale for the most intense phase of the ensuing
star formation in spiral arms, and implies a considerable fraction of
molecular clouds exist only for a few Myr before forming stars. However,
our analysis does not preclude that some molecular clouds persist
considerably longer. If much of the star formation in spiral arms occurs
within this short interval , then star formation must be inefficient, in
order to avoid the short-term depletion of the gas reservoir.

INTRODUCTION

[][hereafter R69]roberts69 was the first to develop the scenario of
spiral-arm-driven star formation in galaxy disks. In this picture a spiral
density wave induces gravitational compression and shocks in the neutral
hydrogen gas, which in turn leads to the collapse of (molecular) gas clouds
that results in star formation. This work already pointed out the basic
consequences for the relative geometry of the dense cold gas
reservoir This paper pre-dates observational studies of molecular gas
in galaxies. and the emergent young stars: when viewed from a reference
frame that corotates with the density wave, the densest part of the atomic
hydrogen ( ) lies at the shock (or just upstream from it), while the young
stars lie downstream from the density wave. Using \ and \ as the
tracers of the cold gas and of the young stars, respectively, R69 found a
qualitative support in the data available at the time. In this picture, the
characteristic timescale for this sequence of events is reflected in the
typical angular offset, at a given radius, between tracers of the different
stages of spiral-arm-driven star formation.

While this qualitative picture has had continued popularity, quantitative
tests of the importance of spiral density waves as star-formation trigger
linshu64\ and of the timescales for the ensuing star formation have
proven complicated. First, it has become increasingly clear that even in
galaxies with grand-design spiral arms, about half of the star formation
occurs in locations outside the spiral arms elmegreen86. Second,
stars formed from molecular clouds (not directly from ) and very young star
clusters are dust enshrouded at first. Moreover, the actual physical
mechanism that appears to control the rate and overall location of star
formation in galaxies is the gravitational instability of the gas and existing
stars [e.g.][]li05. Stars only form above a critical density
martin01 which is consistent with the predicted toomre64\
criterion for gravitational instability as generalized by rafikov01.
Although, in galaxies with prominent spiral structure local gas condensations
are governed by magneto-rotational instabilities---spiral arms are regions of
low shear where the transfer of angular momentum is carried out by magnetic
fields . Obtaining high-resolution, sensitive maps of all
phases in this scenario ( , molecular gas, dust-enshrouded young stars,
unobscured young stars) has proven technically challenging.

If the star formation originates from direct collapse of gravitationally
unstable gas, and if the rotation curve and approximate pattern speed of the
spiral arms are known, the geometric test suggested by R69 provides a
timescale for the end-to-end (from \ to young stars) process of star
formation. Of course, there are other ways of estimating the timescales that
characterize the evolutionary sequence of the interstellar medium (ISM), based
on other physical arguments. However, other lines of reasoning have led to
quite a wide range of varying lifetime estimates as discussed below.

Offsets between components such as CO and \ emission in the disks of
spiral galaxies have indeed been observed
vogel88,garcia93,rand90,scoville01. mouschovias06 remarked
that the angular separation between the dust lanes and the peaks of \
emission found for nearby spiral galaxies [e.g. observed
by][]roberts69,rots75\ implied timescales of the order of 10~Myr. More
recently egusa04, using the angular offset between CO and \ in
nearby galaxies, derived ~ 4.8~Myr.

Observationally, the \ surface density is found to correlate well with
sites of star formation and emission from molecular clouds
wong02,kennicutt98. The conversion timescale of _2 is
a key issue since it determines how well the peaks of \ emission can be
considered as potential early stages of star formation. H_2 molecules only
form on dust grain surfaces in dusty regions that shield the molecules from
ionizing UV photons. Their formation facilitates the subsequent building up of
more complex molecules [e.g.][]williams05. Within shielded clouds
the conversion timescale _2 is given by _ H_2
10^9/n_0\;yr, where n_0 is the proton density in cm^-3
hollenbach71,jura75,goldsmith2005,goldsmith2006. Given the inverse
proportionality with n_0, the conversion timescale can vary from the edge of
a molecular cloud ( 4 10^6\;yr, n_0 10^3) to the central
region ( 10^5\;yr, n_0 10^4) where the density is higher. Local
turbulent compression can further enhance the local density, and thus decrease
the conversion timescale glover07. Thus, even short cloud-formation
timescales remain consistent with the _2 conversion timescale.

The subsequent evolution [see e.g. ][ for a review]beuther06\
involves the formation of cloud cores (initially starless) and then star
cluster formation through accretion onto protostars, which finally become main
sequence stars. High-mass stars evolve more rapidly than low-mass stars.
Stars with M 5 M_ reach the main sequence quickly, in less than 1
Myr hillenbrand93,palla99, while they are still deeply embedded and
actively accreting. The O and B stars begin to produce an intense UV flux that
photoionizes the surrounding dusty environment within a few Myr, and
subsequently become optically visible thronson86.

A different scenario is suggested by allen02, in which young stars in
the disks of galaxies produce \ from their parent H_2 clouds by
photodissociation. According to this scenario, the \ should not be seen
furthest upstream in the spiral arm, but rather between the CO and UV/ \
regions. allen86\ indeed report observation of \ downstream of
dust lanes in M83.

Several lines of reasoning, however, point toward longer star-formation
timescales and molecular cloud lifetimes, much greater than 10~Myr.
krumholz05\ conclude that the star-formation rate in the solar
neighborhood is low. In fact, they point out that the star-formation rate in
the solar neighborhood is 100 times smaller than the ratio of the masses
of nearby molecular clouds to their free-fall time M_ MC/ _ ff,
which also indicates the rate of compression of molecular clouds. Individual
dense molecular clouds have been argued to stay in a fully molecular state for
about 10-15~Myr before their collapse tassis04, and to transform
about 30\
10^6\;yr e.g. considering the mass of the Orion Nebula Cluster,
ONC][]tan06. Large molecular clouds have been calculated to survive 20 to
30~Myr before being destroyed by the stellar feedback by
KrumholzMatzner06. Based on observations, palla99,palla00\
argue that the star formation rate in the ONC was low 10^7\;yr ago, and that
it increased only recently. blitz06, using a statistical comparison
of cluster ages in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to the presence of CO,
found that the lifetime for giant molecular clouds is 20--30~Myr.

However, other studies conclude that the timescales for star-formation are
rather short. hartmann03\ pointed out that the Palla--Stahler model
is not consistent with observations since most of the molecular clouds in the
ONC are forming stars at the same high rate. The stellar age or the age spread
in young open stellar clusters is not necessarily a useful constraint on the
star-formation timescale: the age spread, for example, may result from
independent and non-simultaneous bursts of star-formation
elmegreen2000. ballesteros06\ pointed out that the
molecular cloud lifetime must be shorter than the value of _
MC 10\;Myr suggested by mouschovias06. Also subsequent star
formation must proceed very quickly, within a few Myr
vazquez05,HBB01. prescott07\ found strong association
between 24\; sources and optical \ regions in nearby spiral
galaxies. This provides constraints on the lifetimes of star-forming clouds:
the break out time of the clouds and their parent clouds is less or at most of
the same order as the lifetime of the \ regions, therefore a few Myr.
Dust and gas clouds must dissipate on a timescale no longer than 5--10 Myr.

In conclusion, all the previous studies listed aim to estimate the lifetimes
of molecular clouds or the timescale separation between the compression of
neutral gas and newly formed stars. Most of these studies are based on
observations of star-forming regions both in the Milky Way and in external
galaxies, and in all cases the derived timescales lie in a range between a few
Myr and several tens of Myr.

In this paper, we examine a new method ( ~) for estimating
the timescale to proceed from \ compression to star formation in nearby
spiral galaxies. We compare Spitzer Space Telescope/MIPS 24\:
data from the Spitzer Near Infrared Galaxies Survey (SINGS;
kennicutt03) to 21~cm maps from the \ Nearby Galaxy Survey
(THINGS; walter07). The proximity of our targets allows for high
spatial resolution. In ~\ we give a description of the data.
The MIPS bands (24, 70 and 160\; ) are tracers of warm dust heated by UV
and are therefore good indicators of recent star-formation activity
[see for example][]dale05. We used the band with the best resolution,
24\; , which has been recognized as the best of the Spitzer bands
for tracing star formation calzetti05,calzetti07,prescott07; the
8\; Spitzer/IRAC band has even higher resolution but is
contaminated by PAH features that undergo strong depletion in the presence of
intense UV radiation dwek05,smith07. In ~\ we
describe how we use azimuthal cross-correlation to compare the \ and
24\; images and derive the angular offset of the spiral pattern. This
algorithmic approach minimizes possible biases introduced by subjective
assessments. We describe our results in ~\ where we derive
\ for our selection of objects. Finally, we discuss the implications of
our results in ~\ and draw conclusions in
~.

METHODOLOGY

The main goal of this paper is to estimate geometrically the timescales for
spiral-arm-driven star formation using a simple kinematic model, examining the
R69 arguments in light of state-of-the-art data. Specifically, we set out to
determine the relative geometry of two tracers for different stages of
star-formation sequence in a sample of nearby galaxies, drawing on the SINGS
and THINGS data sets (see ~): the 24~ \ and the \
emission.

While the angular offset between these two tracers is an empirical
model-independent measurement, a conversion into a star-formation timescale
assumes (a) that peaks of the \ trace material that is forming molecular
clouds, and (b) that the peaks of the 24~ \ emission trace the very young,
still dust-enshrouded star clusters, where their UV emission is absorbed and
re-radiated into the mid- to far-infrared wavelength range ( 5~ \ to
500 ). The choice of these particular tracers was motivated by the
fact that they should tightly bracket the conversion process of molecular gas
into young massive stars, and by the availability of high-quality data from
the SINGS and THINGS surveys. Note that a number of imaging studies in the
near-IR have shown [e.g. ][]rix95\ that the large majority of
luminous disk galaxies have a coherent, dynamically relevant spiral arm
density perturbation. Therefore, this overall line of reasoning can sensibly
be applied to a sample of disk galaxies.

We consider a radius in the galaxy disk where the spiral pattern can be
described by a kinematic pattern speed, _p, and the local circular
velocity v_c(r) (r) r. Then two events separated by a
time will have a phase offset of

(r) = ( (r)- _p)\; ,

where \ denotes the time difference between two particular phases that we
will study here. If the spiral pattern of a galaxy indeed has a characteristic
kinematic pattern speed, the angular offset between any set of tracers is
expected to vary as a function of radius in a characteristic way. Considering
the chronological sequence, defining the angular phase difference
_24\, m- _ HI and adopting the
convention that increases in the direction of rotation, we expect the
qualitative radial dependence plotted in Figure~:
>0 where the galaxy rotates faster than the pattern speed,
otherwise <0. Where (R_ cor)= _p, at the
so-called corotation radius, we expect the sign of to change.

In practice, the gaseous and stellar distribution is much more complex than in
the qualitative example of Figure~, since the whole spiral
network, even for galaxies where the spiral arms are well defined such as in
grand-design galaxies, typically exhibits a full wealth of smaller scale
sub-structures both in the arms and in the inter-arm regions. The optimal
method to measure the angular offset between the two observed patterns is
therefore through cross-correlation ( ~). We treat the
timescale \ and the present-day pattern speed _p as global
constants for each galaxy, although these two parameters might, in principle,
vary as function of galactocentric radius. Note that we need not to rely on
the assumption that the spiral structure is quasi-stationary over extended
periods, t t_ dyn. Even if spiral arms are quite dynamic,
continuously forming and breaking, and with a pattern speed varying with
radius, our analysis will hold approximately.

DATA

The present analysis is based on the 21~cm emission line maps, a tracer of the
neutral atomic gas for the 14 disk galaxies listed in Table~,
which are taken from THINGS. These high-quality NRAO The National
Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation
operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\ Very
Large Array observations provide data cubes with an angular resolution of
6'' and spectral resolution of 2.6 or 5.2~ . Since the target
galaxies are nearby, at distances of 3--10~Mpc, the linear resolution of the
maps corresponds to 100--300~pc. The \ data cubes of our target galaxies
are complemented with near-IR images, which are public data. In particular,
the majority of the THINGS galaxies (including all those in
Table~) have also been observed within the framework of the
SINGS and we make an extensive use of the 24\; MIPS images (see
~). Figure~\ illustrates our data for two of the
sample galaxies, NGC~5194 and NGC~2841. The 24\; band image is shown in
color scale, and the contours show the \ emission map. To obtain the
exponential scale length of the stellar disk (see ~), we
use 3.6\; Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) images when available, otherwise
we use H band images taken from the Two Micron All Sky Survey
[2MASS;][]jarrett03. To check the consistency of our results, we use
CO maps from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Aaaociation Survey Of Nearby
Galaxies [BIMA-SONG][]helfer03\ for some of our target galaxies.

ANALYSIS

All analysis in this paper started from fully reduced images and data cubes.
On this data we carry out two main steps. First, we derive the rotation curve
v_c(r) of the \ and the geometrical projection parameters of the galaxy
disk, and use these parameters to deproject the maps of the galaxies to
face-on orientation (see Table~). Second, we sample the face-on
maps in concentric annuli. For each annulus we cross-correlate the
corresponding pair of \ and 24\; fluxes, in order to derive the
angular offset between the \ and the 24\; patterns as a function of
radius.

For three of the galaxies listed in Table~\ (NGC~628, NGC~5194,
and NGC~3627), we also measure the angular offset between the CO and
24\; emission maps. If the ISM evolves sequentially from atomic into
molecular gas, and then subsequently initiates the formation of stars,
considering the kinematics expressed in Eq.~, we expect the CO
emission to lie in between the \ and the 24\; .

Analysis of the \ Kinematics

For each object we apply the same general approach: we first perform adaptive
binning of the \ data cube regions with low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio
using the method described by cappellari03. From the resulting
spatially binned data cubes we fit the 21~cm emission lines with a single
Gaussian profile and use the parameterization to derive (1) the line-of-sight
velocity map v(x,y), given by the line centroid, and (2) the flux maps
_0(x,y) a(x,y)/( 2 \, (x,y)), where a and
are the Gaussian peak amplitude and width, respectively. Since we do not need
to derive the rotation curve with high accuracy for the purpose of this paper,
we limit our model to a co-planar rotating disk with circular orbits described
by

v(x,y)=v_ sys+v_c(r)\, i ,

where v(x,y) is the observed velocity map along the line of sight
[see][]begeman89. For simplicity, we assume here that the orbits are
circular, though we address the issue of non-circular motions in
~. By ^2 minimization fitting The fitting
has been performed with the mpfit IDL routine found at
the URL:
http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/ craigm/idl/fitting.html\ of the model
function in Eq.~\ to the observed velocity map v(x,y), we
obtain the systemic velocity v_ sys= const, the inclination i and
the position angle (P.A.) of the geometric projection of the disk on to the
sky. Here, is the azimuthal angle on the plane of the inclined disk
(not the sky) and is a function of i and P.A. The line where =0
denotes the orientation of the line of nodes on the receding side of the disk.
The kinematic center (x_0,y_0) is fixed a priori and is defined as the
central peak of either the IRAC 3.6\; or the 2MASS H band image. The
positions of the dynamical centers used here are consistent with those derived
in trachternach07. We parameterize the deprojected rotation curve
v_c with a four-parameter arctan-like function [e.g., ][]rix97

v_c(r)=v_0\;(1+x)^ \; (1+x^- )^-1/ ,

where x=r/r_0. Here, r_0 is the turn-over radius, v_0 is the scale
velocity, determines the sharpness of the turnover and is the
asymptotic slope at larger radii.

The values for the projection parameters i, and P.A., the systemic velocity
v_ sys, and the asymptotic velocity that have been obtained applying
the approach described above, are consistent with the values reported in
Table~. From the maximum value of Eq.~\ we obtain
the maximum rotational velocity v_ max, which is listed for all the
sample galaxies in Table~.

Azimuthal Cross-Correlation

The central analysis step is to calculate by what angle the
patterns of \ and 24\; need to be rotated with respect to each other
in order to best match. We use the kinematically determined orientation
parameters, i and P.A., to deproject both the \ and 24\; images to
face-on. To estimate the angular offset between the two flux
images at each radius, we divide the face-on images into concentric rings of
width 5'' and extract the flux within this annulus as a function of
azimuth. We then use a straightforward cross-correlation (CC) to search for
phase lags in f_ HI( |r) versus f_24\, m( |r). In
general, the best match between two discrete vectors x and y is realized
by minimizing as a function of the phase shift (also defined as
lag) the quantity

^2_x,y( )= _k [x_k-y_k- ]^2,

where the sum is calculated over all the N elements of x and y with
k=0,1,2,...,N-1. Specifically here, for a given radius r= r we
consider for all discrete values of azimuth :

x_k=f_ HI( _k| r) and
y_k- =f_24\, m( _k- | r).

Expanding the argument of the sum in Eq.~\ one obtains
that ^2( ) is independent of the terms _k x_k^2 and _k
y_k- ^2, and ^2 is minimized by the maximization of

cc_x,y( )= _k [x_k\,y_k- ],

which is defined as the CC coefficient. Here we used the normalized CC

cc_x,y( )= _k [(x_k- x)\,(y_k- - y) ]
_k (x_k- x)^2\; _k (y_k- y)^2,

where x and y are the mean values of x and y respectively.
Here the slow, direct definition has been used and not the fast Fourier
transform method. The vectors are wrapped around to ensure the completeness
of the comparison. With this definition the CC coefficient would have a
maximum value of unity for identical patterns, while for highly dissimilar
patterns it would be much less than 1. We apply the definition in
Eq.~\ using the substitutions of Eq.~\ to compute
the azimuthal CC coefficient cc( ) of the \ and the 24\; images.
The best match between the \ and the 24\; signals is realized at a
value _ max such that cc( _ max) has its peak value.
Since the expected offsets are small (only a few degrees) we search the local
maximum around 0. The method is illustrated in
Figure~, which shows that cc( ) has several peaks, as
expected due to the self-similarity of the spiral pattern.

Representative examples for the determination of the azimuthal
--24~ \ offset: shown is the cross-correlation cc( ) of the
two functions f_ HI( _k, r) and f_24\,
m( _k- , r), as a function of azimuth offset
at a fixed radius r. The present example shows the cc( )
profile calculated for NGC~628 at r 2' ( 4.2~kpc)
and NGC~5055 at r 2.6' ( 6.4~kpc), in the left and
right columns, respectively. Top panel: the cc( ) profile in the
entire range [-180^ ,180^ ]; bottom panel: a zoom of the
range [-30^ ,30^ ]. We considered an adequate range greater
than the width of the cc( ) profile around _ max and
interpolated cc( ) locally ( 10^ in the two example
plots) with a fourth-degree polynomial
p_4( )= _n=0^4a_n\, ^n, and calculated numerically the
peak value _ max. The bottom panel shows the fit residuals
overplotted around the zero level.
figure*

We consider a range that encompasses the maximum of the cc( ) profile,
i.e. the central 100--150 data points around _ max. This
number, depending on the angular size of the ring, is dictated by the
azimuthal spread of the spiral arms and the number of substructures (e.g.,
dense gas clouds, star clusters, etc.) per unit area. This corresponds, for
example, to a width in of a few tens of degrees at small radii (
1'), depending on the distance of the object, and a range in width of
decreasing linearly with the radius. We interpolate cc( ) around
_ max with a fourth-degree polynomial using the following
approximation: cc( ) p_4( )= _n=0^4a_n\, ^n and
calculate numerically (using the Python http://www.python.org\
package scipy.optimize) the peak value at _ max,
p_4( _ max). By repeating the procedure for all radii, the angular
offset 24\; results in (r)=- _ max(r).
The direction or equivalently the sign of the lag _ max between two
generic vectors x and y depends on the order of x and y in the
definition of the CC coefficient. Note that cc_x,y( ) in
Eq.~\ is not commutative for interchange of x and y,
being cc_y,x( )=cc_x,y(- ). For _ max=0 the two
patterns best match at zero azimuthal phase shift. The error bars for
_ max(r) have been evaluated through a Monte Carlo approach,
adding normally distributed noise and assuming the expectation values of
_ max and _ max as the mean value and the standard
deviation, respectively, after repeating the determination N=100 times.

Our analysis is limited to the radial range between low S/N regions at the
galaxy centers and their outer edges. In the \ emission maps the S/N is
low near the galaxy center, where the \ is converted to molecular H_2,
whereas for the 24\; band the emission map has low S/N near R_25
(and in most cases already at 0.8\:R_25). Regions with S/N~<3 in
either the \ or 24\; images have been clipped. We also ignore those
points _ max with a coefficient cc( _ max) lower than a
threshold cc 0.2. We further neglect any azimuthal ring containing
less than a few hundred points, which occurs near the image center and near
R_25. The resulting values (r) are shown in
Figure~.

Disk Exponential Scale Length
We also determine the disk exponential scale length R_s for our sample
using the galfit Found at URL:
http://zwicky.as.arizona.edu/ /work/galfit/galfit.html\ algorithm
peng02. In particular, we fit an exponential disk profile and a de
Vaucouleurs profile to either the IRAC 3.6\; or to the 2MASS H band
image. As galfit underestimates the error on R_s (as recognized by the
author of the algorithm), typically R_s/R_s<1\
use the IRAF task ellipse jedrzejewski87\ to derive the radial
surface brightness profile and fit R_s. After testing the procedure on a few
objects, we note only small differences (of the order of the error bars in
Table~) when deriving R_s from the H band and the
3.6\; band.

RESULTS

Angular Offset

With the angular offset (r) _24\,
m- _ HI (r), where increases in the direction of
rotation, and the rotation curve v_c(r) for each radial bin, we can rewrite
Eq.~\ as

(r) = ( v_c(r)r- _p )
\; \;t_ HI 24\, m,

where (r) v_c/r. Since (r)> _p inside the
corotation radius R_ cor, and (r)< _p outside corotation,
we expect (r)> 0 for r<R_ cor and (r)< 0 for
r>R_ cor. At corotation, where (R_ cor)= 0, the two
components \ and 24\; should have no systematic offset. We assume
\ and _ p to be constant for any given galaxy, and that all
the spirals are trailing, since the only spiral galaxies known to have a
leading pattern are NGC~3786, NGC~5426 and NGC~4622
thomasson89,byrd02. By ^2 fitting the model prediction of
Eq.~\ to the measured angular offsets (r) in all
radial bins of a galaxy, we derive best-fit values for \ and _
p.

The (r) data and the resulting best-fits are shown in
Figure~, with the resulting best-fit values listed in
Table~. In Figure~\ we plot for all objects the
radial profile of the angular offsets (r). The solid line
represents the best fit model proscribed by Eq.~. The square
symbols in the plot represent the fitted data points from ~.
Looking at the ensemble results in Figure~, two points are
noteworthy: (1) the geometric offsets are small, typically a few degrees and
did need high-resolution maps to become detectable, (2) the general radial
dependence follows overall the simple prescription of Eq.~\
quite well.

\ and R_ cor

Because (r) is consistent with (and follows) the predictions of
the simple geometry and kinematics in Eq.~, the procedure
adopted here turns out to be an effective method to derive the following: (1)
the time lag , which should bracket the timescale needed to compress the
molecular gas, trigger star formation, and heat the dust; it therefore
represents also an estimate for the lifetime of star-forming molecular clouds;
(2) the kinematic pattern speed _p of the galaxy spiral pattern and,
equivalently, the corotation radius R_ cor.

We now look at the ensemble properties of the resulting values for \ and
R_ cor. The scatter of the individually fitted points is
significantly larger than their error bars (as shown in Fig.~),
which may be due to the galactic dynamics being more complex than our simple
assumptions. For example, the pattern speed may not be constant over the
entire disk or there may be multiple corotation radii and pattern speeds, as,
for instance, found by numerical simulations sellwood88\ and observed
in external galaxies hernandez05.

Even though a considerable intrinsic scatter characterizes (r) for
most of our sample galaxies, and the error bars of \ listed in
Table~\ are typically >15\,\
characteristic timescales \ in Figure~\ shows overall a
relatively small spread for a sample of 14 galaxies of different Hubble types:
the timescales \ occupy a range between 1 and 4 Myr for almost all the
objects.

The solid curve in Figure~, representing the prescription of
Eq.~, intersects the horizontal axis at the corotation
radius R_ cor, which can be formally derived by inverting
Eq.~\ at =0. We report in Table~\
the ratio between R_ cor and the exponential scale length R_s for
each object and show this result in Figure~. Comparisons of our
pattern speed _p measurements with other methodologies
[e.g.][]tremaine84\ are listed in Table~. The
differences with our results may arise since the Tremaine--Weinberg method
assumes the continuity condition of the tracer, which may break down for the
gas as it is easily shocked, it changes state, and it is converted into stars
, or it can be obscured by dust .
Comparison of the observed non-axisymmetric motions with hydrodynamical models
based on the actual stellar mass distribution kranz03\ have found a
characteristic value of R_ cor/R_s 2.7 0.4 for a sample of
spirals. We plot this range with dashed vertical lines in
Figure~, whereas the solid curve in each panel denotes the actual
fit value of R_ cor/R_s for each object. Figure~\
illustrates the interesting fact that the corotation values found in the
present paper, R_ cor/R_s 2.7 0.2, agree well with the
completely independent estimates that kranz03 derived by a different
approach and for a different sample. Therefore, a generic value for the
pattern speed of the dominant spiral feature of R_ cor/R_s
2.7 0.4 seems robust.

Comparison With CO Data

If the basic picture outlined in the introduction is correct, then the
molecular gas traced by the CO, as an intermediate step in the star-formation
sequence, should lie in between and have a smaller offset from the \ than
the 24\; does, but in the same direction. To check this qualitatively,
we retrieve the BIMA-SONG CO maps helfer03\ for the galaxies NGC~628,
NGC~5194, and NGC~3627. For comparison, we derive the angular offset between
the CO emission and the 24\; , applying the same method described above
for the . The results are plotted in Figure~. The scarcity
of data points (e.g., NGC~628) and their scatter, which is typically larger
than the error bars, make estimates of t_ CO 24\, m
and R_ cor rather uncertain. Therefore, we simply focus on
_ CO-24(r) versus _ Hi-24(r), which is
shown in Figure~. This figure shows that the values of
_ CO-24 all lie closer to zero than the values of
_ Hi-24.

Hence this check shows that the peak location of the molecular gas is
consistent with the evolutionary sequence where the \ represents an earlier
phase than the CO. In this picture the \ has a larger spatial separation
with respect to the hot dust emission, except at corotation, where the three
components are expected to coincide. However, it is clear that higher
sensitivity CO maps are needed to improve this kind of analysis.

Analysis of Non-Circular Motions

So far we have carried out an analysis that is based on the assumption of
circular motions. We quantify here non-circular motions and determine to what
extent their presence affects the estimate of the timescales , which scale
with . In the classic picture (e.g., R69), the radial velocity of
the gas is reversed around the spiral shock, so that the material is at nearly
the same galactocentric radius before and after the shock. Gas in galaxies
with dynamically important spiral arms does not move on circular orbits,
though. Shocks and streaming motions transport gas inwards, and gas orbits
undergo strong variations of direction. If a continuity equation for a
particular gas phase applies, it implies that in the rest frame of the spiral
arm, the change of relative velocity perpendicular to the arm v_ is
proportional to the arm to pre-arm mass flux ratio [for a recent
illustration in M51 see][ hereafter S07]shetty07. For example, for an orbit
passing through an arm with mass density contrast of 10, v_ would drop
by the same factor, producing a net inward deflection of the orbit. We do note
that the gas continuity equation may not actually be valid, since stars may
form, or the gas may become molecular or ionized. Non-circular motions could
modify the simplified scheme of Fig.~. If the orbit is inward
bound near the arm, the path of the material between the \ and the
24\; arm components is larger than that previously assumed for circular
orbits. We reconsider the scheme of Fig.~\ for a non-circular
orbit in the frame corotating with the spiral pattern as illustrated in
Fig.~. Here, the material moves not along a line at
constant radius r, but along a line proceeding from a larger radius r+
r, specifically from the point A (see Fig.~) on the
\ arm toward the point B on the 24\; arm, where the two parallel
horizontal lines denote the galactocentric distances r+ r and r. The
material departs from A with an angle inwards (if the material were
to proceed instead from an inner radius, then is directed outwards).
If is large, the measurement of the spatial shift
A'B r\, ^ in the simple scheme of circular
(deprojected) rings no longer represents the actual value of the spatial
offset AB , but rather is only a lower limit.
Consequently, the measurement of the timescale \ would be underestimated,
since ~ from Eq.~. From the geometry
of the triangle ABA' in Fig.~, and since
A'B ^ and AB ,
it can be straightforwardly shown that

(r)= ^ (r)\: ( + ),

where

= . -v_Rv_ ^ |_r+ r,

v_R(r) and v_ ^ (r)=v_ - _p\,r are the radial and
tangential velocity components of the gas in the arm frame, respectively, and
is the \ arm pitch angle defined by

= . _ arm r
|_r,

with 90^ for a tightly wound spiral. Note that the
radial and the azimuthal dependences of v_R and v_ ^ are anchored
to each other at the spiral arms through Eq.~. It follows
that if the radial and tangential components of the gas velocity, and the
pitch angle of the \ spiral arms are known, the actual value of

k(r) ( + )

to the directly measured quantity ^ . Note from
Fig.~\ that if 90- , then

Methodology

In these circumstances, if spiral arms in galaxies are dynamically affecting
the gas kinematics, then it is sensible to test the effects of non-circular
motions especially in strong arm spiral galaxies from our sample. We select,
NGC~5194 (M51), NGC~628, and NGC~6946. Therefore, we examine the extreme
case, calculating along a narrow region along spiral arms how much the
streaming motions affect our angular offset measurements, thus the derivation
of the timescales . Subsequently, we generalize the procedure accordingly
with our specific methodology by averaging these effects over the product of
~ ~24~ \ fluxes, which is the weighting function of the
cross-correlation.

The radial and tangential velocity components are difficult to separate
unambiguously. The radial component is accurately measured along the minor
axis, where however information on the azimuthal component is lost. The
opposite occurs along the major axis. Therefore, we follow the prescriptions
for non-circular streaming motions analysis from ~3 of S07, to separate the
velocity components v_R and v_ from the observed \ velocity field
v_ obs, adopting


v_ obs(R, )=v_ sys + (v_R(R, )\, +v_ (R, )\, ) \: i

as a generalization of Eq.~. Knowing v_R and v_ , then
we obtain the geometry of the orbits using Equations~\ and
. Specifically, the \ column density and velocity map
are deprojected and resampled into a polar coordinate system (R, ) for
simplicity, so that the azimuthal phase of the spiral arms can be described by
a logarithmic spiral = _ arm- _0= (R_ arm/R_0), for
a given fiducial radius R_0. We extract the observed velocity v_ obs
along logarithmic lines as illustrated in Fig.~, which best
represent the arm phase. Though these logarithmic lines are drawn by eye, on
top of the spiral arms, we obtain reasonable results, e.g., for the case of
NGC~5194 we find a logarithmic slope of 26 , similar to the 21 \ found by
S07. Assuming v_R and v_ to be constant along equal arm phases, we
fit Eq.~\ to the observed velocities extracted at each arm
phase [ _ arm, _ arm+2 ]. The fitting gives v_R
and v_ as a function of and therefore as a function of radius
through Eq.~\ (see also S07). Provided the angles
and from Eq.~\ and Eq.~, we
straightforwardly calculate the actual value of the angular offset
given ^ from circular orbits assumption using
Eq.~\ and Eq.~.

Consistently with gomez02\ and S07, we find in the three considered
galaxies that the locations of the spiral arms coincide with a net drop-off of
the tangential velocity and negative radial velocity, possibly indicating that
near the arms the orbits bend inwards. We then calculate, using
Eq.~, the correction k(r) at the position of the arms,
indicated in Fig.~, where we expect the largest variations for
v_R and v_ . Even so, we find for the three considered galaxies that
k(r) results near unity for all radii, except where v_ ^
approaches zero, which does not necessarily coincide with corotation, but
rather where the division in Eq.~\ diverges and the error
bars are large. In particular, for NGC~5194, where | |<20^ for
all r, the correction k(r) ranges between 0.7 and 1.2, and for both
NGC~628 and NGC~6946 k(r) ranges between 0.9 and 1.5, as indicated in
Fig.~. After calculating the corrected offsets
from Eq.~, and fitting
Eq.~\ to the values , we find that the timescale
\ and the pattern speed _p do not change significantly---the
differences are below the error bars for the three galaxies. Note that the
data points where v_ ^ 0, that is where Eq.~\
diverges, are not excluded from the fit. The results of these fits are listed
in Table~\ and plotted in Fig.~. We also
find that the radial displacements,
r
r\, [ ^ (r)]\,k(r)\, [ (r)],

are typically as small compared to the radial steps of ^ ,
i.e. | r|<70~pc for all r for NGC~5194. In ~\ we
calculated ^ through Eq.~, hence not only
within the spiral arms, but also as intensity-weighted mean across all the
azimuthal values. If we were to calculate the angle-averaged value
^ from the average v_R and
v_ weighted by the product ~ ~24\; , which is the
weighting function of the cross-correlation, we find 0 for all
radii and a correction k(r) even closer to unity than over a region limited
to the arms. With this approach we obtain 0.95<k(r)<1.05 for NGC~5194.

After exploring the two extreme cases, (1) simple model of circular orbits and
(2) streaming motions near spiral arms for galaxies with prominent spiral
structure---where these effect are supposed to be the largest---we find that
the implied timescales \ do not vary significantly. By estimating the
streaming motions in three galaxies from our data set, we find that the
correction k(r) which we must apply to the angular offset measurements in
the scheme of circular orbits is generally near unity. Non-circular motions do
not greatly affect the offset measurements for the galaxies with
the most prominent spiral arms of our data set, where we expect indeed the
highest deviations from circular orbits, suggesting that, since
\; , the timescales \ will not vary by more than a
factor of 1.5.

However, these conclusions should be viewed cautiously, since (1) we are
assuming that v_R and v_ can be obtained by fitting
Eq.~, and (2) we do not account for beam effects. While the
presence of non-circular motions produces apparent radial variations of
inclination and position angle, our estimates are suggesting that these
effects do not influence much the determination of the timescales. Yet, tidal
interactions could ensue physical variations of inclination and position
angle, thus of the actual geometry of the observed velocities. Although we
note that among the sample galaxies only NGC~3031 (M81), NGC~3627, NGC~5055,
and NGC~5194 are affected by tidal interaction. Moreover, we do not consider
extra-planar motions due to the implied numerical difficulties. For instance,
to include a vertical velocity component v_z into Eq.~\
would introduce a degeneracy while fitting v_R, v_ , and v_z, and a
degeneracy in the geometry of the motions, rendering the estimates of the
timescales uncertain. However, after subtracting a circular orbit model from
the observed velocity field of the galaxy NGC~3184, an inspection of the
velocity residuals reveals deviations from circular motions of
5--10~ \ amplitude, and about zero near the spiral arms. Considering
that NGC~3184 is nearly face-on (i=16 ), then vertical motions should not
exceed 5--10~ . The beam deconvolution, on the other hand, would enlarge
the uncertainties on separating v_R and v_ , but we rely on a
resolution size limit which is far below the typical thickness of a spiral arm
and allows us to resolve fine sub-structures within the arms. We also rely on
a large number of data points---several hundred to several thousand depending
on the galactocentric radius.

DISCUSSION

By analyzing the angular offsets between \ and 24\; in the context of
a simple kinematic model, we found short timescales, , as summarized in
the histogram of Figure~\ and in Table~. The
implied characteristic timescales for almost all sample galaxies lie in the
range 1--4 Myr. This result sets an upper limit to the timescale for massive
star formation under these circumstances, since we are observing the time lag
between two phases: a) the atomic gas phase, which subsequently is
compressed into molecular clouds and forms clusters of young, embedded,
massive stars, and b) the warm dust phase, produced by heating from young
stars, whose UV radiation is reprocessed by the dust into the mid-IR, as
observed at 24\; . For the few objects where there are suitable CO data,
we checked that this geometric picture also holds for the molecular phase.

Timescales Derived from Pattern Offsets

egusa04\ used the same angular offset technique to compare CO and
\ emission. They report timescales ~ 4.8~Myr for the galaxy
NGC~4254 (not in our sample). The \ traces a later evolutionary stage
than the warm dust emission, which can indicate the presence of a young
cluster still enshrouded by dust. Therefore, the \ and the dust
emission are expected to be separated by the time needed to remove the dusty
envelope, though they are observed to be spatially well correlated
wong02,kennicutt98. prescott07\ found a strong association
between 24~ \ sources and optical \ regions in SINGS galaxies. Also
infrared sources located on top of older, UV-bright, clusters that do not have
\ emission are rare. Since prescott07 suggest that the break
out time from dust clouds is short ( 1~Myr), we do not expect a strong
offset. egusa04 derived the angular offset by subjective assessment
of the separation of the intensity peaks. They report that this may be a
source of systematic errors, since they cannot detect by eye, the angular
phase differences less than a certain threshold and in turn, their results
would possibly be an upper limit. Given these considerations, the timescales
derived in this paper are likely consistent with the conclusions of
egusa04.

rots75\ and garcia93\ found time lags of 10~Myr for
M81 and M51, respectively. In particular, Rots applied the angular offset
method to the dust lanes and . This may be in part problematic since
the dust absorption in the optical bands only traces the presence of dust and
it is unrelated to the warm dust emission due to star-formation onset.
Garcia-Burillo et al. measured the spatial separation projected on the sky
between CO and \, and not the azimuthal offset.

allen02\ has argued that \ is a photodissociation product of UV
shining on molecular gas, so it should be seen between the CO and UV/ \
regions. allen86 observed \ between spiral arm dust lanes and
\ regions. However, elmegreen07 points out that there is no time
delay between dust lanes and star formation: dust lanes may only represent a
heavy visual extinction effect and may not be connected to star-formation
onset. Our finding that CO is situated between \ and hot dust (i.e.
Fig.~) stands in conflict with the predictions of the model
proposed by allen02.

The evolutionary timescales of the ISM phases, especially for star formation,
are not well constrained. The observational results of the last few decades,
arrive at different and, in some cases, controversial conclusions. The
discrepancies might in part be attributed to effects of limited resolution
(see ~). This suggests that higher resolution and
sensitivity maps, especially for the CO emission, are needed to improve the
presented technique in the future.

Photodissociation of H_2

We argue that illumination effects of UV radiation shining on molecular and
dusty regions cannot photodissociate molecules in order to produce the
observed peaks of ---which correspond to typical surface densities of
several solar masses per pc^2. First, the mean free path of the UV photons
is remarkably short, typically 100~pc. The presence of dust,
particularly abundant in disk galaxies, is the main source of extinction in
particular within spiral arms, where we observe the peak of dust emission.
Second, none of the galaxies from our data set presents prominent nuclear
activity, whose UV flux could ionize preferentially the inner surfaces of the
molecular clouds. Also, we exclude that UV radiation from young stellar
concentrations can ionize preferentially one side of the clouds causing \
and CO emissions to lie offset with respect to each other, which we instead
interpret as due to an evolutionary sequence. In fact, if the light from young
stars effectively produces \ by photodissociation of H_2, then the
neutral to molecular gas fraction is expected to increase with star-formation
rate per unit area, _ SFR, as a consequence of the increasing UV
radiation flux. Yet, the \ to H_2 ratio decreases with increasing
_ SFR, as also shown, for example, in kennicutt07\ for
the galaxy M51. Moreover, the \ density does not vary much as a function of
_ SFR .

Pattern Speeds

The results of the fits in Figure~\ are consistent with the
existence of a kinematic pattern speed for the considered galaxies, and are
suggesting that the spiral pattern must be metastable at least over a few Myr
or, strictly speaking, quasi-stationary. If the apparent spiral structure seen
in young stars were produced by stochastic self-propagating star formation
[e.g.][]Gerola1978,Seiden1982\ and shear, without an underlying
coherent mass perturbation, then presumably we would not observe the
systematic radial variation of the offsets, seen in Figure~, in
particular not that the offset changes sign at R 2-3\,R_ exp. Our
results, however, do not exclude the stochastic star-formation mechanism to
occur, rather that this is not the dominant trigger of star formation. The
spiral pattern might be the manifestation of full wealth of modes of
propagating density waves, which are continuously forming and dissolving gas
clouds and structures, where, i.e. the azimuthal modes for a grand-design
spiral are dominant at low orders (e.g., m=2,3,4). If the spiral structure
is quasi-stationary, then it can be characterized by an instantaneous pattern
speed to first order---at least over a timescale much shorter than the orbital
time. This is opposed to density waves dynamically driven by bars or
interaction with companions, which could last a few orbital times. Note,
however, that our analysis holds approximately in both possible cases.

Some of the fits in Figure~\ do not accurately mirror the trend
of the observed data points, where the scatter is so large that it renders the
interpretation problematic. In particular, we could designate as a bad fit the
results for the galaxies NGC~3031, NGC~3621, NGC~7793, and NGC~6946
(Table~). We also note that the pattern speed obtained in this
paper for the galaxies NGC~5055 and NGC~5194 disagree with previous
independent measurements [e.g.][]thornley1997,zimmer04. The fit for
NGC~5055 presents large error bars due to the large scatter in the azimuthal
offsets (see Figure~), which may explain the differences. For
NGC~5194 the large difference between our result and the Tremaine--Weinberg
method prediction could be due, as mentioned in ~, to
the assumption of continuity for the gas. In fact, zimmer04\ find a
pattern speed _p^Z 38~ ~kpc^-1 that is much faster than
the pattern speed predicted by the hydrodynamical models from kranz03,
_p^K 12~ ~kpc^-1, using R_ cor 2.7\,R_s and
R_s 1.4'. Moreover, the presence of large variations of the azimuthal
offsets as a function of radius with respect to the smoother fitted curves of
Figure~\ suggests that the pattern speed may not be constant over
the entire disk. Instead, the spiral pattern could be described by more than
one pattern speed, implying that the delay time is not exactly the same in all
parts of an individual galaxy, and not necessarily the same in all the
considered galaxies. However, the offsets measurements and the implied pattern
speeds and timescales could be statistically pointing toward regions of high
\ and 24~ \ fluxes when using the weighting of Equation~,
therefore toward high _ SFR, ensuing the timescales to be
comparable in all cases.

Is Star Formation Triggered by Spiral Waves?

Addressing to our results ( ~ and Fig.~), a
further aspect emerging from our analysis concerns the same general behavior
displayed by an heterogeneous sample of galaxies going from grand-design (e.g.
NGC~5194) to flocculent morphologies (e.g. NGC~2841 and NGC~5055, see also
Fig.~\ for an example comparison). Visual examination of the
IR band images for our sample galaxies (e.g. at 3.6~ ) indicates that
almost all have two-arm or multi-arm coherent spiral arms; for none of these
galaxies the spiral structure is so chaotic as to be characterized as
flocculent. Moreover, both types of galaxies from our sample display
comparable integrated star-formation rates. Grand-design density waves are
not likely to be the primary trigger of star formation, since a substantial
portion of stars are also formed in the inter-arm regions .
The concentration of young stellar populations near prominent spiral arms is
rather an effect of kinematics . Grand-design and flocculent
galaxies exhibit the same intrinsic self-similar geometry
elmegreen03. The difference between these two types of galaxies is
only dictated by a different distribution of azimuthal modes. Large scales
structures (low-order modes) are the dominant features in grand design.
However, the short timescales suggest that the physical scales where star
formation occurs are rather small, since this time delay cannot exceed the
free-fall time. Weak density waves, those described by high-order azimuthal
modes, not necessarily grand-design modes, are likely to facilitate the growth
of super-critical structures which end in star-forming events. In galaxies
morphologically classified as flocculent and grand design, the mechanism that
triggers star formation must be the same---gravitational instability. Direct
compression of gas clouds is indeed able to locally trigger star formation.

The sizes of the structures of active star formation, however, are not
representative of the timescales involved. Star-forming regions are organized
hierarchically according to the small-scale turbulent motions of gas and
stars, where the dynamical time varies as a function of the local scale sizes
. The improved accuracy of recent observational
techniques, e.g. THINGS and SINGS, allows us to observe smaller and smaller
structures, which evolve thus more rapidly and are characterized by shorter
timescales. Stellar activity and turbulence limit the lifetime of molecular
clouds by causing the destruction of the parent cloud and the cloud dispersal,
respectively. This lifetime, typically 10-20~Myr, drops by a factor of
10 for the star-forming clouds. Moreover, star formation begins at high
rate in only a few Myr, appearing in large structures of O-B complexes---beads
on a string---of few hundred pc scales, and remaining active for
30--50~Myr, but with a gradually decreasing star-forming rate, until the
complete quenching . The timescales measured here refer to
the very initial phase of star formation, specifically when star-formation
rate is the highest---traced by 24~ \ peak emission. The time delay \
needs not to represent the average time difference between these two phases,
especially if there is a gradually declining tail of star-formation activity,
taking longer than . If much of the star formation were actually occurring
within our short \ estimate, then star formation would have to be
inefficient to avoid conflicts with the short-term depletion of the gas
reservoir.

Can We Rule Out Timescales of 10 Myr?

Since the 24\; emission traces the mass-weighted star-formation
activity, the timescale \ measures the time for star clusters to form from
\ gas, but it does not show that all molecular clouds live only
2~Myr. It might show that the bulk of massive stars that form in disks has
emerged from molecular clouds that only lived 2~Myr, though there could
still be molecular clouds that live an order of magnitude longer. The full
molecular cloud lifetimes estimated for the LMC correspond to 10~Myr
, while star clusters are formed from
molecular clouds in only few Myr. Yet, more recent observations suggest much
slower evolution. In particular, blitz06\ propose molecular cloud
lifetimes for the LMC as long as 20--30~Myr. In the Milky Way this timescale
is estimated to be a few Myr [e.g. ][]HBB01, but the examined cloud
complexes, such as Taurus and Ophiuchus, have low star-formation rate and
masses more than an order of magnitude lower than those studied by
blitz06. Thus, it remains possible that our results and these
previous arguments are all consistent. At high density star formation also
occurs at higher rate. blitz06 also find that the timescales for the
emergence of the first \ regions traced by \ in molecular clouds is
t_ HII 7\;Myr, which does not exclude that t_ HII t_
HI 24\, m, but it could be problematic with the short
break out suggested by prescott07, since the time delay which is
required between the onset of star formation (as traced by 24\; from
obscured \ regions) and the emergence of \ emission would need to
be large.

In conclusion, we note that the timescale \ results from a ^2 fit to
all the data, and it is treated as a global constant individually for each
galaxy, so it is not a function of radius. Globally, all the characteristic
timescales \ listed in Table~\ are 4~Myr, except one
single case (NGC~925). The error bars are also relatively small: <1~Myr for
the majority of the cases. These results clearly exclude characteristic
timescales \ of the order of 10~Myr, even for the highest value
recorded in our data set which is NGC~925.

Theoretical Implications

The short timescale found here between the peak of \ emission and the peak
of emission from young, dust-enshrouded stars has implications for two related
theoretical controversies. First is the question of whether molecular clouds
are short-lived, dynamically evolving objects ( ballesteros99,
HBB01,elmegreen2000, ballesteros06, elmegreen07) or quasi-static
objects evolving over many free-fall times
matzner02,KrumholzMatzner06. The second, related question is what
the rate-limiting step for star formation in galaxies is: formation of
gravitationally unstable regions in the \ that can collapse into molecular
clouds , or formation
of dense, gravitationally unstable cores within quasi-stable molecular clouds
krumholz05,KrumholzMatzner06,KrumholzTan07.

The short timescales found here for the bulk of massive star formation in
regions of strong gravitational instability appears to support the concept
that molecular cloud evolution occurs on a dynamical time once gravitational
instability has set in, and that the rate-limiting step for star formation is
the assembly of \ gas into gravitationally unstable configurations. Our
work does not, however, address the total lifetime of molecular gas in these
regions, as we only report the separation between the peaks of the emission
distributions. Molecular clouds may well undergo an initial burst of star
formation that then disperses fragments of molecular gas that continues star
formation at low efficiency for substantial additional time
elmegreen07. Averaging over the efficient and inefficient phases of
their evolution might give the overall low average values observed in galaxies
[e.g.][]KrumholzTan07.

CONCLUSIONS

We have derived characteristic star-formation timescales for a set of nearby
spiral galaxies, using a simple geometric approach based on the classic
roberts69\ picture that star formation occurs just downstream from the
spiral pattern, where gas clouds have been assembled into super-critical
configurations. This derived timescale, , refers to the processes from the
densest , to the molecular phase, to enshrouded hot stars heating the dust.
The analysis is based on high-resolution 21~cm maps from THINGS, which we
combined with 24\; maps from SINGS. We assume that the observed spiral
arms have a pattern speed _p. Given the rotation curve,
v_c(r)=r\, (r), this allows us to translate angular offsets at
different radii between the \ flux peaks and the 24\; flux peaks in
terms of a characteristic time difference.

At each individual point along the spiral arm we found considerable scatter
between the \ and 24\; emission peaks. However, for each galaxy we
could arrive at a global fit, using a cross-correlation technique, and derive
two characteristic parameters, \ and R_ cor. For our 14 objects we
found the general relation R_ cor=(2.7 0.2)\,R_s, which is consistent
with previous studies [e.g.][]kranz03\ and, more importantly, we
found \ to range between 1 and 4~Myr. Even when accounting for
uncertainties, at the highest peak of star-formation rate timescales as long
as \; 10\,$Myr, which have been inferred from other approaches, do not
appear consistent with our findings. At least for the case of nearby spiral
galaxies, our analysis sets an upper limit to the time needed to form massive
stars (responsible for heating the dust) by compressing the (atomic) gas.
Therefore, it points to a rapid procession of star formation through the
molecular-cloud phase in spiral galaxies. If star formation really is as rapid
as our estimate of \ suggests, it must be relatively inefficient to avoid
the short-term depletion of gas reservoirs.
