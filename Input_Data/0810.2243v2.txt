abstract
As the number of known exoplanets continues to grow, the question as to whether such bodies harbour satellite systems has become one of increasing interest. In this paper, we explore the transit timing effects that should be detectable due to an exomoon and predict a new observable. We first consider transit time variation (TTV), where we update the model to include the effects of orbital eccentricity. We draw two key conclusions:
1) In order to maintain Hill stability, the orbital frequency of the exomoon will always be higher than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the period of the exomoon cannot be reliably determined from TTV, only a set of harmonic frequencies.
2) The TTV amplitude is M_S a_S where M_S is the exomoon mass and a_S is the semi-major axis of the moon's orbit. Therefore, M_S \& a_S cannot be separately determined.

We go on to predict a new observable due to exomoons - transit duration variation (TDV). We derive the TDV amplitude and conclude that its amplitude is not only detectable, but the TDV signal will provide two robust advantages:
1) The TDV amplitude is M_S a_S^-1/2 and therefore the ratio of TDV to TTV allows for M_S and a_S to be separately determined. 2) TDV has a /2 phase difference to the TTV signal, making it an excellent complementary technique.

Introduction

Over 300 exoplanets have been discovered to date with detection rates escalating (see http://exoplanet.eu by J. Schneider). The detections have been so far biased towards large bodies and the smallest transiting planet to date is still Neptune-sized, for Gliese 436b ( gil07). Current instruments cannot yet detect transiting Earths but transit time variation (TTV) could offer a way to bring sensitivity down to sub Earth-mass level ( hol05 and ago05). Given the large number of moons in our own Solar System, it is reasonable to postulate that satellites are common around exoplanets.

Another profound motivation for looking for exomoons is that they are likely to be terrestrial in nature, based upon our own Solar System, and hence one would propose that exomoons could be more habitable environments than the host of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) so far discovered.

Photometric detection of a moon is likely to be exceptionally challenging. An exomoon is likely to be sub-Earth sized, based upon our Solar System, and so even a specialized transit space-based telescope like COROT will struggle to spot the signature ( sar99). An additional problem lies in the fact that much of the time the exomoon will not appear to be its orbital distance from the planet, but some fraction of it, depending on the orbital phase of the exomoon during transit. The moon can effectively hide behind the planet or in front of it. This makes disentangling the photometric signature exceptionally difficult and was outlined by sar99 and cab07.

Previously, several different authors ( sza06, sar99 and sim07) have noted that transit timing variations (TTV) could be used to indirectly detect the presence of such exomoons. In the first half of this paper, we update the model for the TTV effect by including orbital eccentricity. We compare our formulation to the previously proposed mathematical treatment and demonstrate our model reduces to the original analytic equations for zero eccentricity.

However, the crucial problem with TTV is that the amplitude of the signal is proportional to both the exomoon mass, M_S, and orbital separation, a_S. for07 referred to this obstacle as the `inverse problem', in regard to transit timing effects. In 3.1 we show that the exomoon's period cannot be reliably determined from TTV and hence a_S remains an unknown. Ergo, one cannot establish the mass of the exomoon without assuming a value for the orbital separation. It is therefore clear that a strong desideratum is a secondary method which can complement TTV and remove this degeneracy and this constitutes the focus of the second part of our paper.

By considering the transit duration, we predict a new observable timing effect due to an exomoon, which we label as transit duration variation (TDV). We find that the amplitude of this timing signal is of the same order of magnitude to the TTV signal and indeed often larger. The effect is also predicted to be M_S a_S^-1/2. Hence, the ratio of TDV to TTV allows for the mass of the exomoon to be found without assuming an orbital distance. In addition, TDV is /2 out-of-phase with TTV, making it an ideal complementary method for exomoon detection.

TTV Amplitude due to an Exomoon
Outline of the model

In the first half of this paper, we aim to update the model for the transit timing variation (TTV) signal due a transiting exoplanet with a single satellite of mass M_S and non-zero orbital eccentricity. In this work, we consider the variation of the mid-transit point of the planetary transit, T_MID. This is in contrast to sim07 who consider the planet and moon combined transit. Throughout our discussion, we also make the assumption that planet-moon orbital plane is co-aligned with the planet-star orbital plane at i=90^ .

In our case, the planet orbits the barycentre of the planet-moon system with a semi-major axis of a_W where W denotes wobble. The fact that a_W > 0 means that the time between the planet being at the mid-transit point and the barycentre being at the mid-transit point is, in general, non-zero, and this is the origin of the TTV effect.

Consider the projected distance between the planet and the planet-moon barycentre to be given by x_2', as illustrated in figure 1. The TTV effect will be given by x_2' divided by the x_2'-direction component of the barycentre's orbital velocity around the star, given by v_B . Since x_2' is a function of the planet's true anomaly around the planet-moon barycentre, f_W, so too is the TTV effect:

TTV(f_W) = x_2'(f_W)v_B

In the case of a circular orbit, we expect the TTV signal to have a sinusoidal nature, and infact the peak-to-peak amplitude of the wave may be unambiguously defined as 2 a_W/v_B . In the case of eccentric orbits, we expect non-sinusoidal waveforms, due to Kepler's Equation. Peak-to-peak amplitudes can become ambiguous in such cases, and so we choose to use the root-mean-square (rms) amplitude definition, which is valid for all waveforms. For a simple circular orbit, the rms amplitude of the TTV signal, _TTV, will be given by:

_TTV( circular) = a_W 2 v_B

Where the distance a_W is small enough that we may assume v_B is a constant over the time-scale of the TTV effect.

Let us now extend the analysis to include the effect of exomoon orbital eccentricity, e_S and position of pericentre, _S, as well as planetary eccentricity e_P and position of pericentre, _P. In appendix A, we derive the general equation for the rms amplitude of the TTV effect due to an exomoon to be given by:

_TTV = 1 2 a_P^1/2 a_S M_S M_PRV^-1 G (M_* + M_PRV) _T(e_S, _S) (e_P, _P)

where

_T &= (1-e_S^2)^1/4e_S e_S^2 + (2 _S) (2 (1-e_S^2)^3/2 - 2 + 3 e_S^2)
&= [ ( -e_P _P1+e_P _P ) ] 2 (1+e_P _P)(1-e_P^2)-1

Where a_P is the semi-major axis of the exoplanet's orbit around the central star, a_S is the semi-major axis of the exomoon's orbit around the exoplanet, G is the gravitational constant, M_* is the mass of the host star and M_PRV = M_S + M_P i.e. the combined mass of the exomoon and exoplanet respectively M_PRV is the mass of the planet as measured by radial velocity surveys, and thus includes the mass of satellites.

In the case of e_S 0 we have _T 1 and similarly for e_P 0 we have 1. Thus we may compare our equation to that derived by previous authors, who assumed circular orbits, and expect to produce the same result. sar99 predicted the peak-to-peak amplitude of an exomoon around an exoplanet with orbital period P_P to be given by equation (6).

t_sar99 2 a_S M_S M_P^-1 P_P (2 a_P)^-1

Using Kepler's Third Law, it is trivial to show that this is equivalent to our expression, for circular orbits and M_P M_S, except for a factor of 2 2, which comes from the fact we use an rms definition of amplitude, rather than a peak-to-peak definition. Thus we have confirmed that our general expression for the TTV effect due to an exomoon is equivalent to the circular equations first derived by sar99. For completion, we note that the TTV amplitude may be written purely in terms of the masses of the three bodies and the period of the exoplanet (see appendix A, equation (A28) \& (A29)).

The effect of eccentricity is discussed in more detail in 3.3 and typical waveforms produced are shown later in figure 3, 4.2. In 4.2, Table 1 gives a list of the expected TTV rms amplitudes due to a 1 M_ exomoon around some of the most promising exoplanet candidates.

Permitted range for a_S

The orbital radius of any satellite around a planet must lie somewhere between the Hill radius, d_max, and the Roche limit, d_min, to maintain stability Note, we use the rigid body Roche limit for simplicity. We express a_S by assuming that it is equal to some fraction, , of the Hill radius, d_max.

a_S &= d_max
d_max &= a_P ( M_P3 M_* )^1/3 = a_P ( M_PRV-M_S3 M_* )^1/3
d_min &= R_P (2 _P _S )^1/3

Where a_P is the semi-major axis of the planet around the host star, R_P is the planetary radius, is some real number between 0 and 1, and denotes density.

may be further constrained by noting that bar02 estimated 1/3 and dom06 estimated 1/2. This is because the Hill sphere is just an approximation, and in reality other effects, like radiation pressure or the Yarkovsky effect, can perturb a body outside of the sphere. We choose to use the conservative choice of 1/3 and combining this limit with the Roche limit, and rewriting in terms of planetary period, P_P for M_* M_P, we can estimate:

( 18 G P_P^2 _S )^1/3 13

val06 offer a way of rewriting _S in terms of just the mass of the exomoon by adopting terrestial models of the internal structure for such bodies. If we use R_S M_S^0.27, then we can estimate _S 0.1 M_S^0.19.

1186 ( M_SM_ )^-0.063 ( P_P 1 day )^-2/3 13

Implications
The high frequency nature of an exomoon's TTV

If we make the approximation that M_* M_PRV and M_PRV M_S, and employ Kepler's Third Law, we may provide an estimate for the ratio of the exomoon to planet orbital period, which can be shown (see appendix B) to be:

P_SP_P ^33

Since 1 we will always be in the regime where P_S < P_P. Taking 1/3 gives a rough estimate of P_S/P_P 1/9 and so the frequency of the signal is _S 9 P_P^-1. However, the Nyquist frequency will be given by one half of the sampling rate (0.5 P_P^-1), which represents the maximum frequency we can resolve without aliasing.

The usual technique for detecting signals within data is to employ a periodogram, but this method will suffer from aliasing in the exomoon case. Therefore, we can only derive a set of harmonic frequencies which the exomoon's orbit could exhibit. We therefore conclude P_S cannot be reliably determined from the TTV signal.

The limitation of TTV in determining M_S

As originally pointed by sar99, the major problem with TTV is that one cannot determine the mass of the exomoon without making an assumption on the distance at which the moon orbits the planet. Using equation (3), it is possible to write the TTV amplitude as a function of purely the exomoon properties:

_TTV M_S a_S

Therefore we can effectively only determine the moment of the exomoon. If one knows the period of the exomoon, then it is trivial to derive a_S using Kepler's Third Law, but as seen in 3.1, P_P cannot be reliably ascertained.

This crucial limitation of exomoon TTV makes mass estimation unfeasible and the best we can ever do is merely provide evidence for an exomoon within a large mass range. This severe limitation will be resolved later in this paper.

The effect of eccentricity

The effects of orbital eccentricity on the TTV amplitude are all absorbed into the two parameters, _T(e_S, _S) and (e_P, _P). If we increase e_S from zero to unity, regardless of what value _S takes, _T decreases below 1 and hence the TTV amplitude will always decrease. This implies exomoon detections are biased towards satellites on circular orbits.

The situation is more complicated for e_P, where a non-zero e_P makes the TTV amplitude significantly increased or decreased depending on _P. In figure 2, we plot ^-1 as a function of _P for several different eccentricities and find that for e_P>0, the most favourable position of pericentre is _P 3 /2. However, we point out a recent study by kan08 which predicts such exoplanets to possess a low transit probability.

For the eccentric transiting exoplanets GJ436b, XO-3b, HAT-P-2b and HD17156b, ^-1 takes values 1.01, 1.03, 0.94 and 0.47 respectively. However, the stability of satellites around eccentric exoplanets remains unclear.

Transit Duration Variation (TDV)
The TDV due to an exomoon

Transit duration variation (TDV) is the periodic change in the duration of a transit ( ) over many measurements, where we define as the time between the 1^ st and 4^ th contact points. It has previously been discussed as a possible test of general relativity by pal08. In this discussion, we consider the TDV due to an exomoon and conclude that it should produce a detectable signal.

We first consider that the duration of a transit is inversely proportional to the projected velocity of the planet across the star, v_P , and make the following assumptions:

itemize
[ ] The projected velocity of the planet-moon barycentre during the transit, relative to the star, does not vary significantly over the time-scale of the transit duration.
[ ] The projected velocity of the planet during the transit, relative to planet-moon barycentre, does not vary significantly over the time-scale of the transit duration.
[ ] The orbital inclinations of the planet (i = 90^ ) and exomoon do not vary from orbit to orbit.
[ ] We do not consider additional perturbing bodies in the system.
itemize

1/v_P

In this case, any transit duration variation must be solely due to the variation of the velocity. For a single companion exomoon, the velocity of the planet will have two components:

v_P = v_B + v_W

where v_B is the velocity of the planet-moon barycentre around the host star and v_W is the velocity of the planet around the planet-moon barycentre, i.e. the wobble of the planet due its companion satellite.

It is clear that v_W will be significantly different for each transit unless P_P/P_S is some low-order integer. Sometimes v_W will be additive to the barycentre's velocity and sometimes subtractive resulting in shorter and longer transit durations respectively; an effect we label TDV.

The factor by which will vary must be equal to the ratio of the velocities R = v_W /v_B and from this starting point the TDV amplitude may be shown (see appendix C2) to be equal to:

_TDV = a_Pa_S M_S^2M_PRV (M_PRV + M_*) 2 _D(e_S, _S) (e_P, _P)

where

_D(e_S, _S) = 1 + e_S^2 - e_S^2 (2 _S)1-e_S^2

In an analogous way to the TTV amplitude, this may be re-written in terms of simply the masses in the system, and this equation may be found in the appendix C2, equations (C28) and (C29). We also point out that this effect has the following proportionality:

_TDV M_S a_S^-1/2

As a final note, we point out that in 3.3 we discussed how increasing e_S tends to decrease the TTV amplitude. For the TDV signal, the opposite is true, increasing e_S tends to increase the TDV signal.

TTV \& TDV as complementary methods

From equations (13) and (18), it is clear that the ratio of TDV to TTV should be able to eliminate M_S and we can directly measure the orbital seperation of the exomoon a_S and hence M_S. The introduction of TDV allows for the precise measurement of M_S without any assumption on the orbital separation. Using Kepler's Third Law, it is then possible to derive the exomoon's orbital period, which was shown in 3.1 to be unattainable from TTV alone. In appendix D, it is shown that if we assume e_S 0 (but e_P can take any value between zero and unity), then = _TDV/ _TTV is approximately given by:

= _TDV _TTV 2 P_P 3 ^3/2

Therefore one may determine and hence a_S (and M_S) if one assumes the exomoon has zero eccentricity. This assumption is supported based on a study by dom06 and the pattern observed amongst large (>500km) moons in our own Solar System.

Another major advantage of TDV is that the signal should lag TTV by a /2 phase difference, originating from the fact TTV is a spatial effect whereas TDV is a velocity effect. Unfortunately, the direction and value of the phase shift remains unchanged between prograde and retrograde satellites.

Combining TTV and TDV should allow for a much more significant confirmation of a potential exomoon than just using TTV alone. The phase difference can be seen in the example waveforms in figure 3, where we plot the TTV and TDV waveforms due to a hypothetical exomoon of 1 M_ around a GJ436b for e_S = 0, 0.3 and 0.6.

In Table 1, we predict the TTV and TDV rms amplitudes for a variety of known transiting planets. We include the effects of the known planetary eccentricity, and consider a 1 M_ exomoon with = 1/3 and e_S = 0.

In most cases, the TDV amplitude is actually greater than the TTV amplitude. We do however point out that the error in the transit duration is typically 2-3 times that of the mid-transit time (e.g. alo08). Nevertheless, the signal should be detectable, especially with future telescopes like Kepler see http://kepler.nasa.gov/sci/. It is interesting to note that timing errors of just under 1 second could detect a 1 M_ around a 11.79 M_J exoplanet in the case of XO-3b, a mass ratio of 3 10^-4.

A hypothetical habitable exomoon

Consider a hypothetical exoplanet which is identical to GJ436b except it has a period of P_P = 35.7 days and is on a circular orbit, putting it into the habitable zone of GJ436 with T_eq 300K. Although the Neptune-like planet itself would not be an ideal place to search for life, an Earth mass exomoon would be. Suppose there is a 1M_ exomoon with this planet on a circular orbit and =0.25 and hence a period of P_S 2.5 days. Could we detect such a provocative target using timing effects alone?

The predicted rms TTV amplitude would be 138s and the TDV amplitude would be 60s. For GJ436b, alo08 used the 1.52m Telescopio Carlos S\'anchez telescope and achieved a timing accuracy of 13 seconds and a duration error of 50 seconds. This suggests that the detection of the exomoon should be presently possible through TTV from the ground, and feasible with TDV in the near future. This illustrates that even ground-based instruments could detect an Earth-like body in the habitable zone using timing effects.

Discussion \& Conclusions

We have presented an updated model for the TTV signal due to an exomoon to include the effects of orbital eccentricity in both the exoplanet and the exomoon. From the updated TTV model, we draw the following conclusions:

enumerate
[(a)] TTV is degenerated in that it can only determine M_S a_S, where M_S is the exomoon mass and a_S is the exomoon's orbital radius.
[(b)] The TTV due to an exomoon can be significantly enhanced for exoplanets of e_P > 0 and _P 270^ . However, it remains unclear how dynamically stable such exomoons would be.
[(c)] The TTV frequency will be always be greater than the sampling frequency of once every transit, implying we can only determine a set of possible harmonic frequencies for the exomoon's period, P_S.
enumerate

An exomoon is predicted to have another detectable timing effect on a transit in the form of transit duration variation (TDV). We have derived an equation for predicting the TDV amplitude and drawn the following conclusions:

enumerate
[( a)] The ratio of TDV to TTV allows for the separate determination of M_S and a_S; thus solving the `inverse problem' for exomoons.
[( b)] The TDV signal is of a similar order of magnitude to the TTV signal.
[( c)] the TDV signal is also enhanced for e_P >0 and _P 270^ .
[( d)] TDV lags TTV by a 90^ phase difference, making it an excellent complementary technique for exomoon detection.
enumerate

We also find that current ground-based telescopes could detect a 1 M_ exomoon in the habitable zone around a Neptune-like exoplanet. The author would therefore encourage observers to produce not only their mid-transit times, but also transit durations for each transit, rather than composite lightcurve durations. This will allow constraints to be placed on the presence of exomoons around such planets.
