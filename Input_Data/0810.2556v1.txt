abstract
We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate per
unit gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it to expectations from proposed
star formation laws and thresholds. We use \ maps from THINGS and derive
\ maps from CO measured by HERACLES and BIMA SONG. We estimate the star
formation rate by combining GALEX FUV maps and SINGS 24 maps, infer
stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 data, and use
kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of: the free--fall
and orbital timescales; midplane gas pressure; stability of the gas disk to
collapse (including the effects of stars); the ability of perturbations to
grow despite shear; and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the
SFE of H_2 alone is nearly constant at 5.25 2.5
10^-10~yr^-1 (equivalent to an \ depletion time of 1.9
10^9~yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800~pc resolution.
Where the ISM is mostly , on the other hand, the SFE decreases with
increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably
described by an exponential with scale length 0.2--0.25~r_25. We
interpret this decline as a strong dependence of GMC formation on
environment. The ratio of molecular to atomic gas appears to be a smooth
function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the
--dominated to --dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too
steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free--fall time or orbital
time. Thresholds for large--scale instability suggest that our disks are
stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining
SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe --- phase
balance in the , \ formation and destruction, and stellar feedback
--- governs the formation of GMCs from .

Introduction

In nearby galaxies, the star formation rate (SFR) is observed to
correlate spatially with the distribution of neutral gas, at least to
first order. This is observed using a variety of SFR and gas tracers,
but the quantitative relationship between the two remains poorly
understood. Although it is common to relate SFR to gas surface density
via a power law, the relationship is often more complex. The same
surface density of gas can correspond to dramatically different SFRs
depending on whether it is found in a spiral or irregular galaxy or in
the inner or outer part of a galactic disk. Such variations have
spurred suggestions that the local potential well, pressure, coriolis
forces, chemical enrichment, or shear may regulate the formation of
stars from the neutral interstellar medium (ISM).

In this paper, we compare a suite of proposed star formation laws and
thresholds to observations. In this way, we seek to improve observational
constraints on theories of galactic-scale star formation. Such theories are
relevant to galaxy evolution at all redshifts, but must be tested mainly in
nearby galaxies, where observations have the spatial resolution and
sensitivity to map star formation to local conditions. An equally important
goal is to calibrate and test empirical star formation recipes. In lieu of a
strict theory of star formation, such recipes remain indispensable input for
galaxy modeling, particularly because star formation takes place mostly below
the resolution of cosmological simulations. This requires the implementation
of ``subgrid'' models that map local conditions to the SFR
[e.g.,][]SPRINGEL03.

Our analysis is based on the highest quality data available for a significant
sample of nearby galaxies: \ maps from The \ Nearby Galaxy Survey
[THINGS,][]WALTER08, far ultraviolet (FUV) maps from the GALEX Nearby
Galaxies Survey [][]GILDEPAZ07, infrared (IR) data from the
Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey [SINGS,][]KENNICUTT03, CO
1 0 maps from the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies [BIMA
SONG,][]HELFER03 and CO 2 1 maps from the HERA CO-Line
Extragalactic Survey [HERACLES][]LEROY08. This combination yields
sensitive, spatially resolved measurements of kinematics, gas surface density,
stellar surface density, and SFR surface density across the entire optical
disks of 23 spiral and irregular galaxies.

The topic of star formation in galaxies is closely linked to that of giant
molecular cloud (GMC) formation. In the Milky Way, most star formation takes
place in GMCs, which are predominantly molecular, gravitationally bound clouds
with typical masses 10^5 -- 10^6~M_ [][]BLITZ93.
Similar clouds dominate the molecular ISM in Local Group galaxies
[e.g.,][]FUKUI99,ENGARGIOLA03. If the same is true in other galaxies,
then a close association between GMCs and star formation would be expected to
be a general feature of our data. BIGIEL08 study the relationship
between atomic hydrogen ( ), molecular gas ( ), and the SFR in the same
data used here. Working at a resolution of 750~pc, they do not resolve
individual GMCs, but do find that a single power law with index n = 1.0
0.2 relates H_2 and SFR surface density over the optical disks of spirals.
This suggests that as in the Milky Way, a key prerequisite to forming stars is
the formation of GMCs (or at least H_2).

BIGIEL08 find no similar trend relating \ and SFR. Instead the
ratios of -to- \ and SFR-to- \ vary strongly within and among
galaxies. GMC formation, therefore, appears to be a function of local
conditions. Here we investigate this dependence. We focus on where the ISM
can form gravitationally bound, predominantly molecular structures, i.e., the
``star formation threshold,'' and investigate how the molecular fraction of
the ISM varies with local conditions. In equilibrium, the fraction of the ISM
in GMCs may be set by the timescale over which these structures form.
Therefore we also consider suggested timescales for the formation of GMCs and
compare them to observations.

Maps with good spatial coverage and sensitivity are critical to distinguish
between the various proposed thresholds and timescales. Perhaps the key
observation to test theories of galactic--scale star formation is that the
star formation per unit gas mass decreases in the outer disks of spiral and
irregular galaxies [e.g.,][]KENNICUTT89,MARTIN01,THORNLEY06. The
details of this decrease vary with the specifics of the observations. For
example, MARTIN01 observed a sharp drop in the distribution of \
regions, while UV maps suggest a steady decline , but it is
without dispute that the SFR per unit gas mass does indeed decline [see
also][]WONG02. Maps with good spatial extent contain both regions where GMC
formation proceeds efficiently and regions where it is suppressed. Including
both -rich dwarf galaxies and -dominated spirals offers a similar
contrast.

In , we present a set of star formation laws and
thresholds that we will compare to observations. We phrase these in terms of
the star formation per unit neutral gas, which we call the ``star formation
efficiency.'' This quantity, the inverse of the gas depletion time, removes
the basic scaling between stars and gas and measures how effectively each
parcel of the ISM forms stars.

In , we briefly describe our sample, data, and methodology.
In order to focus the main part of the paper on analysis, we defer most
detailed discussion of data and methodology to the appendices.

In we look at how the star formation efficiency relates
to other basic quantities ( ), proposed laws (
), and thresholds ( ) described in
. In we analyze and interpret
these results. In , we illustrate our conclusions by
comparing predictions for the star formation efficiency to observations. In
, we summarize our results.

Appendices -- contain all the information required
to reproduce our calculations, including descriptions of the data and how we
convert from observables to physical quantities. We present our data as an
electronic table of radial profiles described in Appendix and
as maps and plotted profiles for each galaxy in Appendix .

Background

Following, e.g., [][]KENNICUTT89, we break the topic of star formation
in galaxies into two parts. Where star formation is widespread, we refer to
the quantitative relationship between neutral gas and the SFR as the star
formation law. To predict the SFR over an entire galactic disk, it is
also necessary to know which gas is actively forming stars. This topic is
often phrased as the star formation threshold, but may be more generally
thought of as the problem of where a cold phase (n 4--80~cm^-3,
T 50--200~K) or gravitationally bound clouds can form; both are
thought to be prerequisites to star formation. We give a brief background on
both laws and thresholds, first noting that neither term is strictly accurate:
``laws'' here refer to observed (or predicted) correlations and the
``threshold'' is probably a smooth variation from non-star forming to actively
star forming gas.

We cast this discussion in terms of the star formation efficiency (SFE).
There are many definitions for the SFE, but throughout this paper we use the
term only to refer to the star formation rate surface density per unit neutral
gas surface density along a line of sight, i.e., SFE= _ SFR /
_ gas with units of yr^-1. We will also discuss SFE~( )
which refers to the SFR per unit \ ( _ SFR/ _
H2), and SFE~( ) ( _ SFR/ _ HI). The SFE is the
inverse of the gas depletion time, the time required for present day star
formation to consume the gas reservoir. It represents a combination of the
real timescale for neutral gas to form stars and the fraction of gas that ends
up in stars, e.g., if 1\
the SFE=10^-9~yr^-1. Because it is normalized by _ gas,
the SFE is more useful than _ SFR alone to identify where
conditions are conducive to star formation (i.e., where gas is ``good at
forming stars'').

As we describe proposed laws ( ) and thresholds (
), we present quantitative forms for each that can be
compared to the observed SFE. Table collects these expressions,
which we compare to observations in .

Star Formation Laws

A star formation law should predict the SFE from local conditions. Here we
describe three proposals for the limiting timescale over which gas forms
stars: the free-fall timescale in the gas disk, the orbital timescale, and the
characteristic timescale for cloud-cloud collisions. We also describe
proposals that GMCs form stars with a fixed SFE and that the midplane gas
pressure regulates the fraction of the ISM in the molecular phase. We present
each proposal as a prediction for the SFE in terms of observables. These
appear together in the upper part of Table . We expect a
successful star formation law to reproduce the observed SFE (in practice,
combined with an empirical calibration).

Disk Free-Fall Time With Fixed Scale Height

The most common formulation of the star formation law is a power law relating
gas and star formation (surface) densities following
SCHMIDT59,SCHMIDT63. KENNICUTT89,KENNICUTT98A calibrated this
law in its observable (surface density) form. Averaging over the star-forming
disks of spiral and starburst galaxies, he found

_ SFR _ gas^1.4~,

often referred to as the ``Kennicutt--Schmidt law.''

The exponent in Equation , n 1.5, can be approximately
explained by arguing that stars form with a characteristic timescale equal to
the free--fall time in the gas disk, which in turn depends inversely on the
square root of the gas volume density, _ ff _
gas^-0.5 [e.g.,][]MADORE77. For a fixed scale height _
gas _ gas and _ SFR _
gas^1.5. The first star formation law that we consider is thus


SFE _ gas^0.5~,

which is approximately Equation .

Disk Free-Fall Time With Variable Scale Height

If the scale height is not fixed, but instead set by hydrostatic equilibrium
in the disk, then


_ ff 1 _ mp, gas
_ g _ gas~ 1 + _* _
gas _ g _*,z

where _ g and _*,z are the (vertical)
velocity dispersions of gas and stars, _ gas and _ *
are the surface densities of the same, and _ mp, gas is the
midplane gas density. Equation combines the expression for
midplane density from [][their Equation 34]KRUMHOLZ05 and midplane gas
pressure from [][his Equation 11, used to calculate
_P]ELMEGREEN89. The second star formation law that we consider is


SFE _ ff^-1 _ gas _ g~ (1 + _* _ gas _ g _*,z )^0.5~,

which incorporates variations in the scale height and thus gas
volume density with a changing potential well.

Orbital Timescale

It is also common to equate the timescale for star formation and the orbital
timescale [e.g.,][]SILK97,ELMEGREEN97. KENNICUTT98A and
WONG02 found that such a formulation performs as well as Equation
. In this case


SFE _ orb^-1 = 2 =
v(r_ gal)2 r_ gal~.

where v(r_ gal) is the rotational velocity at a
galactocentric radius r_ gal and is the corresponding angular
velocity.

Cloud--Cloud Collisions

TAN00 suggested that the rate of collisions between gravitationally
bound clouds sets the timescale for star formation so that

SFE _ orb^-1~Q_
gas^-1~ (1 - 0.7 )~.

where Q_ gas, defined below, measures gravitational
instability in the disk and = d ~v(r_ gal) / d ~r_
gal is the logarithmic derivative of the rotation curve. The dependence on
reflects the importance of galactic shear in setting the frequency of
cloud-cloud collisions. In the limit = 0 (a flat rotation curve) this
prescription reduces to essentially Equation ; for = 1
(solid body rotation) the SFE is depressed by the absence of shear.

Fixed GMC Efficiency

If the SFE of an individual GMC depends on its intrinsic properties and if
these properties are not themselves strong functions of environment or cloud
formation, then we expect a fixed SFR per unit molecular gas, SFE~( ).
KRUMHOLZ05 posited such a case, arguing that the SFE of a GMC depends
on the free--fall time in the cloud, itself only a weak function of cloud mass
in the Milky Way . BIGIEL08 found support for this
idea. Studying the same data used here, they derived a linear relationship
between _ H2 and _ SFR on scales of 750~pc.

SFE~( ) is likely to appear constant if: the scaling relations and mass
spectrum (i.e., the intrinsic properties) of GMCs are approximately universal,
the gas pressure is low enough that GMCs are largely decoupled from the rest
of the ISM, individual resolution elements contain at least a few GMCs, and
the properties of a cloud regulate its ability to form stars [
and][]BIGIEL08. This is the fifth star formation law
that we consider, that star formation in spiral galaxies occurs mostly in GMCs
and that once such clouds are formed, they have approximately uniform
properties so that



SFE~ ( H_2 ) = constant~,

which we can convert to the SFE of the total gas given R_ mol
= _ H2 / _ HI, the ratio of \ to \ gas. Then

SFE = SFE~ ( H_2 ) R_ molR_ mol+1

or if we measure only _ HI (as is the case in dwarfs),
then SFE~ ( HI ) = SFE~ ( H_2
)~R_ mol.

The balance between GMC/ \ formation and destruction will set R_ mol
= _ H2/ _ HI. If GMCs with fixed lifetime form over a
free fall time or orbital time then R_ mol _ ff^-1
or R_ mol _ orb^-1 ( ), which we
have noted in Table . Combined with Equation , an
expression for R_ mol predicts the SFE.

Pressure and Phase of the ISM

WONG02, BLITZ04, and [][]BLITZ06 explicitly
consider R_ mol. Following ELMEGREEN89 and
ELMEGREEN94, they identify pressure as the critical quantity
that sets the ability of the ISM to form . They show that the
midplane hydrostatic gas pressure, P_ h, correlates with this
ratio in the inner parts of spiral galaxies.

Pressure, which is directly proportional to the gas volume density, should
affect both the rate of \ formation/destruction and the likelihood of a
gravitationally unstable overdensity condensing out of a turbulent ISM
. ELMEGREEN89 gives the following
expression for P_ h,

P_ h 2~G~ _ gas~ ( _ gas +
_ g _*,z _* )~,

and ELMEGREEN93 predicted that the fraction of gas in the
molecular phase depends on both P_ h and the interstellar radiation
field, j, via R_ mol P^2.2~j^-1. If _ SFR
_ H2 and we make the simple assumption that j
_ SFR then ELMEGREEN93 predicts


R_ mol ~P_h^1.2~ ~or~ _ H2 = _ HI
P_h^1.2~,

which combines with Equation to predict the SFE.

WONG02 and BLITZ06 found observational support for Equation
. Using a modified Equation appropriate where
_* _ gas, BLITZ06 fit a power law of the
form

R_ mol = _ H2 _ HI = (
P_hP_0 )^ ~,

finding P_0 = 4.3 10^4~cm^-3~K, the observed pressure
where the ISM is equal parts \ and , and a best--fit exponent
= 0.92. WONG02 found = 0.8. ROBERTSON08 recently
found support from simulations for 0.9.

Star Formation Thresholds

We have described suggestions for the efficiency with which gas form stars,
but not whether gas forms stars. A ``star formation threshold'' is often
invoked to accompany a star formation law. This is a criterion designed to
address the question ``which gas is actively forming stars?'' or ``where can
the ISM form gravitationally bound, molecular clouds?'' and proposed
thresholds have mostly focused on the existence of gravitational or thermal
instability in the gas disk.

A common way to treat the issue of thresholds is to formulate a critical gas
surface density, _ crit, that is a function of local conditions
--- kinematics, stellar surface density, or metallicity. If _ gas
is below _ crit, star formation is expected to be suppressed; we
refer to such regions as ``subcritical.'' Where the gas surface density is
above the critical surface density, star formation is expected to be
widespread. We refer to such regions as ``supercritical.''

In practice, we expect to observe a drop in the SFE associated with the
transition from super- to subcritical. We do not necessarily expect SFE
= 0 in subcritical regions. Even with excellent resolution, a line of sight
through a galaxy probes a range of physical conditions. At our working
resolution of 400 -- 800~pc, each resolution element encompasses a wide range
of local conditions. Within a subcritical resolution element, star formation
may still occur in isolated pockets that locally meet the threshold criterion.

Expressions for star formation thresholds are collected in the lower part of
Table .

Gravitational Instability

KENNICUTT89, KENNICUTT98A, and MARTIN01 argued that
star formation is only widespread where the gas disk is unstable against large
scale collapse. Following TOOMRE64, the condition for instability in
a thin gas disk is

Q_ gas = _g~ ~G~ _ gas~< 1~.

where _g is the gas velocity dispersion, G is the
gravitational constant, and is the epicyclic frequency, calculated
via

= 1.41~ v(r_ gal)r_ gal~ 1+ ~,

where = d ~v(r_ gal) / d ~r_ gal.

MARTIN01 found that \ regions are common where _ gas
exceeds a critical surface density derived following Equation ,

_ crit,Q = _Q~ _g~ ~G~.

In regions where _ gas is above this threshold, gas is
unstable against large scale collapse, which leads to star formation. Below
the threshold, Coriolis forces counteract the self-gravity of the gas and
suppress cloud/star formation. The factor _Q is an empirical
calibration, the observed average value of 1/Q_ gas at the star
formation threshold. For an ideal thin gas disk, the condition for gas to be
unstable to collapse is _Q > 1. At the edge of star forming disks,
KENNICUTT89 found _Q = 0.63 and MARTIN01 found
_Q = 0.69 (Q_ gas 1.5).

KENNICUTT89 and MARTIN01 mention the influence of stars as a
possible cause for Q_ gas > 1 at the star formation threshold.
HUNTER98 present an in-depth discussion of how several factors
influence _Q, e.g., stars and viscosity lower it, while the thickness
of the gas disk raises it. KIM01,KIM07 argue based on simulations
that the observed threshold corresponds to the onset of nonlinear,
non-axisymmetric instabilities. SCHAYE04 and DEBLOK06 suggest
a different explanation, that _Q 1 because _g has been
systematically mishandled; they point out that _g measured from 21-cm
emission will overestimate the true velocity dispersion of gas in a cold
phase.

The stellar potential well may substantially affect the stability of the gas
disk. RAFIKOV01 extended work by JOG84 to provide a
straightforward way to calculate the instability of a gas disk in the presence
of a collisionless stellar disk. RAFIKOV01 defined

Q_ stars = _*,r~ ~G~ _*

where _*,r is the (radial) velocity dispersion of stars
and _* is the stellar mass surface density. The condition for
instability in the gas disk is

1Q_ stars + gas = 2Q_ stars q1+q^2 + 2Q_
gas~R~ q1 + q^2 R^2 > 1~,

where q = k _*,r / , with k the wavenumber of the
instability being considered, and R = _ g/ _*,r. The
minimum value of Q_ stars + gas indicates whether the gas disk is
unstable to large scale collapse. In our sample, typical values of q
correspond to wavelengths = 2 / k 1--5~kpc.

[][]HUNTER98 and BLITZ04 observed strong correlations between
star and GMC formation and the distribution of stars, consistent with stellar
gravity playing a key role in star formation. YANG07 recently showed
that Q_ stars + gas does an excellent job of predicting the location of
star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud and BOISSIER03 showed
that including stars improves the correspondence between Q and star
formation in disk galaxies. LI05,LI06 found the same results from
numerical simulations of disk galaxies, i.e., that stability against large
scale collapse depends critically on the stellar potential well, with star
formation where Q_ stars+gas 1.6.

Galactic Shear

Motivated by the failure of the Toomre Q_ gas threshold in dwarf
irregular galaxies, HUNTER98 suggested that collecting the material
for cloud formation may be easier than implied by Q_ gas, e.g., through
the aid of magnetic fields [see also][]KIM01. They hypothesize that
the destructive influence of galactic shear may instead limit where GMCs can
form and describe a threshold that depends on the ability of clouds to form in
the time allowed by shear.

This threshold is based on the local shear rate, described by Oort's A
constant

A = - 0.5~r_ gal~ d dr_ gal~.

Substituting = v(r_ gal) / r_ gal,

A = 0.5~ ( v(r_ gal)r_ gal - dv(r_
gal)dr_ gal ) = 0.5~ v(r_ gal)r_ gal~ ( 1 - )

Then the threshold has the form

_ crit,A = _A~ _g~A ~G~.

HUNTER98 suggest _ A = 2.5, but this
normalization for _ crit,A is relatively uncertain. The value
chosen by HUNTER98 corresponds to perturbations growing by a factor of
100 during the time allowed by shear, which roughly matches both the
surface density contrast between _ HI and a GMC and the condition
Q_ gas 1 where dv(r_ gal)/dr_ gal = 0.

The practical advantage of shear over Q_ gas is that shear is low in
dwarf galaxies and the inner disks of spiral galaxies ( = 1 for solid
body rotation), both locales where widespread star formation is observed. In
the outer disks of spiral galaxies --- where star formation cutoffs are
observed --- rotation curves tend to be flat ( = 0) so that
_ crit, A and _ crit, Q reduce to the same form.

Formation of a Cold Phase

The very long time needed to assemble a massive GMC from coagulation of
smaller clouds suggests that most GMCs in galaxy disks form ``top down''
[e.g.,][]MCKEE07. However this does not necessarily require that the
whole gas disk to be unstable. Where cold \ is abundant, the lower
velocity dispersion associated with this phase may render the ISM locally
unstable , leading to the formation of GMCs and stars.

Therefore, instead of large-scale gravitational instability or cloud
destruction by shear, the ability to form a cold neutral medium
[][]MCKEE77,WOLFIRE03 may regulate GMC formation. SCHAYE04
argues based on modeling that near the cutoffs observed by MARTIN01
gas becomes mostly cold \ and H_2, _g drops accordingly, and Q
becomes <1 in the cold gas. In a similar vein, ELMEGREEN94 suggest
that the star formation efficiency in the outer parts of galaxies drops
because the pressure becomes too low to allow a cold phase to form even given
perturbations, e.g., from supernova shocks. BRAUN97 found support for
this idea using 21--cm observations; he associated networks of high surface
brightness filaments with cold \ and showed that these filaments are
pervasive across the star forming disk, but become less common at large radii
[though work on THINGS by][calls this result into question]USERO08.

SCHAYE04 modeled the ISM to estimate where the average temperature
drops to 500~K, the molecular fraction reaches 10^-3,
and Q_ gas 1; good indicators that cold \ is common and
\ formation is efficient. These all occur where _ gas
exceeds

_ S04 6.1 M_ ~ pc^-2~f_
g^0.3~ ( Z0.1 Z_
)^-0.3~ ( I10^6~ cm^-2~ s^-1 )^0.23,

where f_ g _ gas / ( _ gas +
_* ) is the fraction of mass in gas (we assume a two-component disk),
Z is the metallicity of the ISM, and I is the flux of ionizing photons.
_ S04 also depends on the ratio of thermal to turbulent pressure
and higher order terms not shown here. SCHAYE04 selects fiducial
values to match those expected in outer galaxy disks, but concludes that the
influence of Z, f_ g, and the radiation field is relatively small.
Most reasonable values yield _ S04 3 -
10~M_ ~pc^-2.

SCHAYE04 argues that a simple column density threshold may work as
well as dynamical thresholds. This agrees with the observation by, e.g.,
SKILLMAN87 and DEBLOK06 that a simple \ column density
threshold does a good job of predicting the location of star formation in
dwarf irregulars. This threshold, _ HI
10~M_ ~pc^-2, also corresponds to the surface density above which
\ is observed to saturate [][]MARTIN01,WONG02,BIGIEL08; that is,
gas in excess of this surface density in spiral galaxies is in the molecular
phase.

Data

The right hand column of Table lists the observables required to
evaluate each law or threshold. We require estimates of: the surface density
of atomic gas ( _ HI), molecular gas ( _ H2), star
formation rate ( _ SFR), and stellar mass ( _ *), the
velocity dispersions of gas and stars ( _ gas and _*), and
the rotation curve (v(r_ gal)). Estimates of the metallicity await
future work.

We assemble maps and radial profiles of the necessary quantities in 23 nearby,
star--forming galaxies that we list in order of increasing stellar mass in
Table . These are galaxies for which we could compile the
necessary data, which means the overlap of THINGS, SINGS, the GALEX NGS, and
(for spirals) either BIMA SONG or HERACLES.

We work with two subsamples: 11 -dominated, low-mass galaxies and 12 large
spiral galaxies. In Table , the galaxies that we classify
``dwarf galaxies'' lie above the horizontal dividing line. These have
rotation velocities v_ rot 125~km~s^-1, stellar masses
M_* 10^10~M_ , and M_B -20~mag. The galaxies that
we label ``spirals'' lie below the dividing line and have v_ rot
125~km~s^-1, M_* 10^10~M_ , and M_B -20~mag.

This division allows us to explore two distinct regimes in parallel. Compared
to their larger cousins, dwarf galaxies have low metallicities, intense
radiation fields, lower galactic shear, and weak or absent spiral structure.
Metallicity, in particular, should have a strong effect on the thermal balance
of the ISM. In lieu of direct measurements, separating the sample in this way
allows us to assess its impact.

We treat the two subsamples slightly differently in two ways. First, we place
data for spirals at a common spatial resolution of 800~pc and data for dwarf
galaxies at 400~pc. The spirals in our sample are farther away than the dwarf
galaxies with larger physical radii, and this approach ensures a good number
of resolution elements across each galaxy and a fairly uniform angular
resolution of 20 (see Table ).

Second, we use CO maps combined with a constant CO-to-H_2 conversion factor,
, to derive _ H2 in spirals, while we treat the molecular
gas content of dwarf galaxies as unknown (see Appendix ). CO
emission in very low mass galaxies is usually weak or not detected
[e.g.,][and see Table ]TAYLOR98,LEROY05 and its
interpretation is confused by potential variations in . Because dwarf
galaxies lack -filled \ depressions like those observed in the centers
of spirals, we expect _ HI to at least capture the basic
morphology of the total gas. Although we do not measure _ H2 in
dwarf galaxies, we consider our results in light of the possibility of an
unseen reservoir of molecular gas ( ).

Appendices -- explain in detail how we translate
observables into physical quantities. Here and in Table we
summarize this mapping.

Atomic Hydrogen Surface Density (Appendix ): We derive
atomic gas mass surface density, _ HI, from 21-cm line integrated
intensity maps obtained by WALTER08 as part of the THINGS survey using
the Very Large Array The VLA is operated by the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory, which is a facility of the National Science
Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities,
Inc.. _ HI is corrected for inclination and includes a factor
of 1.36 to account for helium.

Molecular Hydrogen Surface Density (Appendix ): In spirals,
we estimate the molecular gas mass surface density, _ H2, from CO
line emission. For 10 galaxies we use data from HERACLES, a large program at
the IRAM IRAM is supported by CNRS/INSU (France), the MPG (Germany)
and the IGN (Spain)~30--m telescope that used the HERA
focal plane array to map a subsample of THINGS in the CO
J=2 1 line. For NGC~3627 and NGC~5194, we use J=1 0
line maps from the BIMA SONG survey .

We convert from CO line intensity to _ H2 assuming a constant
CO-to-H_2 conversion factor appropriate for the solar neighborhood, =
2 10^20~ , and a fixed line ratio I_ CO (2 1)
= 0.8~I_ CO (1 0), typical of the disks of spiral galaxies.
We correct for the effects of inclination and include a factor of 1.36 to
reflect the presence of helium .

Galactic Rotation (Appendix ): We fit a simple functional
form to the high quality rotation curves derived from THINGS by
DEBLOK08 and the THINGS first moment maps . These fits
yield smooth, well--behaved (analytic) derivatives and match the observations
well. Two galaxies (NGC~3077 and NGC~4449) have complex velocity fields that
require substantial effort to interpret and we omit them from analyses
requiring kinematics.

Gas Velocity Dispersion (Appendix ): We assume a fixed gas
velocity dispersion, _ gas = 11~km~s^-1, a value motivated by
the THINGS second moment maps.

Stellar Velocity Dispersion (Appendix ): We estimate the
vertical stellar velocity dispersion, _*,z, from hydrostatic
equilibrium, the assumption of an isothermal disk, and an estimated (radially
invariant) stellar scale height. We derive this scale height for each galaxy
from our measured stellar scale length and an average flattening ratio for
disk galaxies. We take the vertical and radial velocity dispersions to be
related by _*,z = 0.6~ _*,r.

Stellar Surface Density (Appendix ): We estimate the
stellar surface density, _*, from Spitzer 3.6 maps, mostly
from SINGS . To avoid contamination by hot dust and
foreground stars, we construct radial profiles only, using the median
3.6 intensity in each tilted ring. We convert from 3.6 intensity
to _* via an empirical K-to-3.6 calibration and adopt a fixed
K-band mass-to-light ratio, = 0.5~M_ /L_ ,K.

Star Formation Rate Surface Density (Appendix ): We combine
FUV and 24 maps to derive maps of _ SFR; giving us a tracer
sensitive to both exposed and dust-embedded star formation. The FUV data come
from the GALEX Nearby Galaxies Survey and the 24 maps
are part of SINGS. Because this precise combination of data is new, Appendix
includes an extended motivation for how we convert intensity to
_ SFR.

Methodology

We work with maps of _ HI, _ H2 and _
SFR on the THINGS astrometric grid. All data are placed at a common
spatial resolution, 400~pc for dwarf galaxies and 800~pc for spirals; when
necessary, we use a Gaussian kernel to degrade our data to this resolution.
The convolution occurs before any deprojection and may be thought of as
placing each subsample at a single distance. Radial profiles of these maps and
_* appear in Appendix .

Using these data, we compute each quantity in Table for
each pixel inside 1.2~r_25 and derive radial profiles over the
same range following the methodology in Appendix
. Because we measure _* and v(r_ gal)
only in radial profile, these maps are often a hybrid between radial
profiles and pixel--by--pixel measurements.

In -- , we analyze the combined
data set for the two subsamples and avoid discussing results for
individual galaxies. We refer readers interested in individual
galaxies to the Appendices. Appendix gives our radial
profile data and the atlas in Appendix shows maps of
_ HI, _ H2, total gas, unobscured
_ SFR, dust-embedded _ SFR, and total
_ SFR, as well as profiles of the quantities in Table
.

In keeping with our emphasis on the combined dataset, we default to quoting
the mean and 1 scatter when we give uncertainties in parameters
derived from the ensemble of galaxies (we usually estimate the scatter using
the median absolute deviation to reduce sensitivity to outliers). We prefer
this approach to giving the uncertainty in the mean because we are usually
interested in how well a given number describes our whole sample, not how
precisely we have measured the mean.

Results

Here we present our main observational results, how the star formation
efficiency varies as a function of other quantities. We begin in
by showing the SFE as a function of three basic parameters:
galactocentric radius, stellar surface density, and gas surface density. Then
in , we look at SFE as a function of the laws described in
. Finally, in we show the SFE as
a function of the thresholds described in .

We present these results as a series of plots that each show SFE as a function
of another quantity. These all follow the format seen in Figure

On the left, we show results for radial profiles. Each point shows the average
SFE over one 10 -wide tilted ring in one galaxy. The color indicates
whether the ISM averaged over the ring is mostly (> 50\

pixel-by-pixel plots verify that conclusions based on rings hold
pixel-by-pixel down to kiloparsec scales.

We do not analyze data with _ gas < 1~M_ ~pc^-2
because the SFE is not well-determined for low gas surface densities; that is,
we only address the question ``where there is gas, is it good at forming
stars?'' Data with _ SFR <
10^-4~M_ ~yr^-1~kpc^-2 are treated as upper limits. These
are red arrows in the radial profiles plots. In the pixel-by-pixel plots,
hatched regions show the area inhabited by 95\
10^-4~M_ ~yr^-1~kpc^-2, i.e., the hatched regions
indicate the area where we are incomplete. In the pixel--by--pixel plots, we
include data out to r_25, while we plot radial profile data out to
1.2~r_25.

SFE and Radius

We argued in that a critical observation for theories of
galactic--scale star formation is that the SFE declines in the outer parts of
spiral galaxies. Figure shows this via plots of SFE against
galactocentric radius (normalized to r_25) in our two subsamples.

In spiral galaxies (top row), the SFE is nearly constant where the ISM is
mostly \ (magenta), which agrees with our observation of a linear
relationship between _ H2 and _ SFR in
[][]BIGIEL08. Typically, the ISM is equal parts \ and \ at
r_ gal = 0.43 0.18~r_25 ( ). Outside this
transition, the SFE decreases steadily with increasing radius. This decline
continues to r_ gal r_25, the limit of our data. This is
similar, though not identical, to the observation by KENNICUTT89 and
MARTIN01 that star formation is not widespread beyond a certain
radius.

The SFE in spirals can be reasonably described in two ways. First, a constant
SFE in the inner parts of galaxies followed by a break at 0.4~r_25
(slightly inside the transition to a mostly- \ ISM):


SFE =
\ arraycl 4.3 10^-10 & r_ gal < 0.4 r_25
2.2 10^-9~ ( -r_ gal0.25~r_25 ) & r_ gal > 0.4 r_25
array~ .
yr^-1~.

Alternatively, we can adopt Equation , appropriate
for a fixed SFE ( ), and derive the best-fit exponential relating R_
mol to r_ gal,


SFE &=& 5.25 10^-10~ R_ molR_ mol + 1~ yr^-1
R_ mol &=& 10.6~ (-r_ gal / 0.21~r_25 )~,

which appears as a thick dashed line in the upper panels of Figure
. The two fits reproduce the observed SFE with similar accuracy;
the scatter about each is 0.26~dex, slightly better than a factor of
2.

In dwarf galaxies (lower panels), we observe a steady decline in the SFE with
increasing radius for all r_ gal, approximately described by


SFE = 1.45 10^-9~ ( -r_ gal / 0.25 ~r_25
)~ yr^-1~

with 0.4~dex scatter about the fit, i.e., a factor of 2--3.

In dwarfs, we take _ gas _ HI, so that SFE=
_ SFR / _ HI. For comparison with Equation
, however, we rewrite Equation assuming
that SFE~( )= 5.25 10^-10~yr^-1, the value measured in
spirals. In terms of R_ mol, Equation becomes


SFE &=& _ SFR _ HI = 5.25 10^-10~R_ mol~ yr^-1
R_ mol &=& 2.76~ (-r_ gal / 0.25~r_25 )~.

The outer parts of dwarfs, r_ gal 0.4~r_25, appear similar to
the outer disks of spiral galaxies in Figure . Surprisingly,
however, we find the SFE to be higher in the central parts of dwarf
galaxies than in the molecular gas of spirals. A higher SFE in dwarf galaxies
is quite unexpected. Their lower metallicities, more intense radiation
fields, and weaker potential wells should make gas less efficient at
forming stars. A simple explanation for the high observed SFE is the presence
of a significant amount of . Figure assumes that
_ gas _ HI in dwarfs. If we miss a significant
amount of \ along a line of sight, we will overestimate the SFE because
we underestimate _ gas. We quantify the possibility of
substantial \ in dwarfs in , but the magnitude of
the effect can be read directly from Equation . At r_
gal = 0, if dwarf galaxies have the same SFE~( ) as spirals, R_
mol 2.76, i.e., _ H2 2.76~ _ HI.

SFE and Stellar Surface Density

Galactocentric radius is probably not intrinsically important to a local
process like star formation, but Figure suggests that local
conditions covariant with radius have a large effect on the ability of gas to
form stars. The radius, r_25, that we use to normalize the x-axis is
defined by an optical isophote and thus measures stellar light. Therefore
r_25 is closely linked to the stellar distribution.

Figure shows this link directly. We plot stellar scale length,
l_*, measured via an exponential fit to the 3.6 profile as a function
of r_25 for our spiral subsample. We see that r_25 = (4.6 0.8)~l_*
and that we could have equivalently normalized the x-axis in Figure
by l_*. We may suspect, then, that the stellar surface
density, _*, underlies the well-defined relation between SFE and
r_ gal observed in Figure .

In Figure , we explore this connection by plotting SFE as a
function of _*. In both spiral and dwarf galaxies, we see a nearly
linear relationship between SFE and _* where the ISM is -dominated
(blue points).

A basic result of THINGS is that over the optical disk of most star forming
galaxies, the \ surface density varies remarkably little [Appendices
and and][]WALTER08. Inspecting our atlas, one
sees that _ HI 6~M_ ~pc^-2 (within a factor
of 2) over a huge range of local conditions, including most of the optical
disk in most galaxies. Because _ gas is nearly constant in the
-dominated (blue) regime, SFE _* approximately defines
a line of fixed specific star formation rate (SSFR), i.e., star formation rate
per unit stellar mass.

The inverse of the SSFR is the stellar assembly time, _* = _* /
_SFR. This is the time required for the present star formation rate
to build up the observed stellar disk. In our spiral subsample, the mean
_10 _* 10.5 0.3, i.e., 3.2 10^10 years or
slightly more than 2 Hubble times. Dwarf galaxies have shorter assembly times,
_10 _* 10.2 0.3 years, about a Hubble time (dashed
lines in Figure show these values using average values of
_ gas for each subsample). Taking these numbers at face value,
dwarfs are forming stars at about their time-average rate, while spirals are
presently forming stars at just under half of their average rate.

We only observe SFE~ _* where the ISM is mostly .
Where the ISM is mostly \ in spirals galaxies, we observe a constant SFE
at a range of _*; similar to the constancy as a function of r_
gal observed in the inner parts of spirals (Figure ). The
transition between these two regimes occurs at _* = 81
25~M_ ~pc^-2 ( ) in spirals. In dwarfs, lines
of sight with _* above this transition value exhibit systematically
high SFE, lending further, albeit indirect, support to the idea that these
points correspond to unmeasured .

Figures and show that where the ISM is mostly
, the star formation rate per unit gas (SFE) is nearly constant
and that where the ISM is mostly , the star formation rate per unit
stellar mass (SSFR) is nearly constant. Together these observations
suggest that , stars, and star formation have similar structure with all
three embedded in a relatively flat distribution of . Figure
shows that the scale lengths of these three distributions are, in fact,
comparable. The star formation rate (black) and CO (gray) scale lengths of
spiral galaxies are both roughly equal to the stellar scale length:

l_ CO = (0.9 0.2)~l_* ~and~ l_ SFR = (1 0.2)~l_*~.

REGAN01 also found that l_ CO l_*
comparing K-band maps to BIMA SONG and YOUNG95 found l_

CO 0.9~l_* and (4.6 0.8)~l_* = r_25.

proportional to the free--fall time in a fixed scale height
disk. Clearly the line cannot describe both high and low SFE data,
even if the normalization is adjusted, and so changes in this
timescale cannot drive the radial decline that we observe in the
SFE.
figure*

This link between _* and the SFE is somewhat surprising because it is
common to view _ SFR, and thus the SFE, as set largely by
_ gas alone over much of the disk of a galaxy [following,
e.g.,][]KENNICUTT98A. In Figure we show this last slice
through SFR-stars-gas parameter space, plotting SFE as a function of
_ gas.

As in Figures and , we observe two distinct
regimes. In spirals, where _ gas > 14 6~M_ ~pc^-2
( ) the ISM is mostly \ and we observe a fixed SFE.
This _ gas, shown by a vertical dotted line, corresponds
approximately to both N(H) 10^21~cm^-2 star formation threshold
noted by SKILLMAN87 and the saturation value for \ observed by,
e.g., [][]MARTIN01 and WONG02 [and seen strikingly in
THINGS at _ gas = 12~M_ ~pc^-2 by][who quote
_ gas = 9~M_ ~pc^-2 but do not include
helium]BIGIEL08.

In contrast to r_ gal and _*, _ gas does not
exhibit a clear correlation with the SFE where the ISM is mostly .
Instead, over the narrow range _ gas
5--10~M_ ~pc^-2, the SFE varies from 3 10^-11 to
10^-9 yr^-1. We see little evidence that _ HI plays a
central role regulating the SFE in either spirals or dwarfs. Rather, the most
striking observation in Figure is that _ HI
exhibits a narrow range of values over the optical disk and is therefore
itself likely subject to some kind of regulation.

The possibility of a missed reservoir of molecular gas in dwarfs is again
evident from the lower panels in Figure . A subset of data has
SFE higher than that observed for \ in spirals and just to the left of
the \ saturation value. If H_2 were added to these points, they would
move down (as the SFE decreases) and to the right (as _ gas
increases), potentially yielding a data distribution similar to that we
observe in spirals.

SFE and Star Formation Laws

We now ask whether the star formation laws proposed in
can explain the radial decline in SFE and whether SFE~( ), already
observed to be constant as a function of r_ gal, _*, and
_ gas (but with some scatter), exhibits any kind of
systematic behavior. We compare the SFE to four quantities that drive the
predictions in Table~: gas surface density (already seen in
Figure ), gas pressure (density), the orbital timescale, and the
derivative of the rotation curve, .

Free--Fall Time in a Fixed Scale Height Disk

A dashed line in Figure illustrates SFE~
_ gas^0.5, expected if the SFE is proportional to the
free-fall time in a fixed scale height gas disk [similar to the
Kennicutt--Schmidt law,][]KENNICUTT98A. The normalization matches
the --dominated parts of spirals and roughly bisects the range
of SFE observed for dwarfs, but large areas of the disk have much
lower SFE than one would predict from this relation. Adjusting the
normalization can move the line up or down but cannot reproduce the
distribution of data observed in Figure .

The culprit here is the small dynamic range in _
HI. Because _ HI does not vary much across the disk,
while the SFE does, the free--fall time in a fixed scale height disk,
or any other weak dependence of SFE on _ gas alone,
cannot reproduce variations in the SFE where the ISM is mostly .
A quantity other than _ gas must play an important role
at radii as low as 0.5~r_25 [a fact already recognized
by][among others]KENNICUTT89.

figure*

We saw in that where the ISM is mostly , the SFE
correlates better with _* than with _ gas. This might be
expected if the stellar potential well plays a central role in setting the
volume density of the gas, _ gas, because _* varies
much more strongly with radius than _ HI. In
we present two predictions relating SFE to _
gas: that the timescale over which GMCs form depends on the _
ff, the free--fall time in a gas disk with a scale height set by
hydrostatic equilibrium Hereafter _ ff refers only to the
free fall time in a gas disk with a scale height set by hydrostatic
equilibrium., and that the ratio R_ mol = _ H2/ _
HI depends primarily on midplane gas pressure, P_ h.

Under our assumption of a fixed _ gas, P_ h
_ gas and both predictions can be written as a power law
relating SFE or R_ mol to P_ h. In Figure
we plot SFE as a function of _ gas and
P_ h (top and bottom x-axis), estimated from hydrostatic
equilibrium (Equation ).

Where the ISM is mostly \ (magenta points) in spirals (top row), we
observe no clear relationship between P_ h and SFE, further evidence
that SFE~( ) is largely decoupled from global conditions of the ISM in
our data.

Where the ISM is mostly \ (blue points) in dwarf galaxies and the outer
parts of spirals, the SFE correlates with P_ h. P_ h predicts
the SFE notably better than _ gas in this regime, supporting the
idea that the volume density of gas (at least ) is more relevant to star
formation than surface density. WONG02 and BLITZ06 observed a
continuous relationship between R_ mol and P_ h, mostly where
_ H2 _ HI. Figure suggests
that such a relationship extends well into the regime where \ dominates the
ISM.

The solid line in Figure illustrates the case of 1\
gas formed into stars per _ ff (SFE~ _
gas^0.5), a typical value at the --to-- \ transition in spirals
( ). Adjusting the normalization slightly, such a line can
intersect both the high and low end of the observed SFE in spirals, but
predicts variations in SFE~( ) that we do not observe and is too shallow
to describe dwarf galaxies.

The dash--dotted line shows R_ mol _ ff^-1
P_ h^0.5, expected for GMC formation over a free fall time. In dwarf
galaxies, where we take _ gas = _ HI, this is
equivalent too SFE _ ff^-1. This description can describe
spirals at high and intermediate P_ h, but is too shallow to capture
the drop in SFE at large radii in spirals and across dwarf galaxies. If
_ ff is the characteristic timescale for GMC formation, effects
other than just an increasing timescale must suppress cloud formation in these
regimes.

A dashed line shows the steeper dependence, R_ mol P_
h^1.2, expected for low R_ mol based on modeling by
ELMEGREEN93. This may be a reasonable description of both spiral and
dwarf galaxies (note that at high SFE, P_ h may be underestimated in
dwarf galaxies because we fail to account for ). We explore how P_
h relates to R_ mol more in .

_ HI _ orb^-1. The SFE is a well-defined
function of _ orb, but the decline in _ orb alone
cannot reproduce the radial decline in SFE or R_ mol.
figure*

The orbital timescale, _ orb, varies strongly with radius and
KENNICUTT98A found _ orb to be a good predictor of
disk--averaged SFE. In Figure , we plot SFE as a function of
_ orb in our sample.

The solid line shows 6\
and is a reasonable match to spirals near the --to-- \ transition
(vertical dotted line). This value agrees with the range of efficiencies found
by WONG02 and with KENNICUTT98A, who found 7\
gas converted to stars per _ orb averaged over galaxy disks
(converted to our adopted IMF). Like WONG02, we do not observe a clear
correlation between SFE and _ orb where the ISM is mostly .

Where the ISM is mostly \ (blue points), the SFE clearly anti-correlates
with _ orb in both spiral and dwarf galaxies. However, we do not
observe a constant efficiency per _ orb. In both subsamples, SFE
drops faster than _ orb increases, so that data at large radii
(longer _ orb, lower SFE) show lower efficiency per _
orb than those from inner galaxies. Although _ orb correlates
with the SFE, the drop in _ orb is not enough on its own to explain
the drop in SFE.

We reach the same conclusion if we posit that _ orb is the relevant
timescale for GMC formation, so that R_ mol _
orb^-1. The dashed lines in Figure show this relation
combined with a fixed SFE~( ) and normalized to R_ mol = 1 at
_ orb = (1.8 0.4) 10^8~years, which we observe at the
--to-- \ transition in spirals ( ). This dependence
is even shallower than SFE _ orb^-1 and cannot reproduce
the SFE in both inner and outer disks by itself. If _ orb is the
relevant timescale for cloud formation, then the fraction of gas that is
actively forming stars must vary substantially between the middle and the edge
of the optical disk.

flat rotation curve. If collisions between GMCs were important to
triggering star formation, we would expect the SFE in the \ dominated
(magenta) parts of spirals to be higher for low (high shear),
which is not apparent from the data.
figure*

TAN00 suggests that cloud-cloud collisions regulate the
SFE. The characteristic timescale for such collisions is _
orb modified by the effects of galactic shear. We saw in Figure
that the SFE of molecular gas is not a strong function
of _ orb. Therefore, in Figure , we plot
the SFE as a function of , the logarithmic derivative of the
rotation curve (we plot SFE against Q_ gas, the other component
of this timescale in ). This isolates the effect of
differential rotation; = 0 for a flat rotation curve and
= 1 for solid body rotation (no shear).

Figure shows a simple relationship between and SFE in
spirals: > 0 is associated with high SFE. High occurs almost
exclusively at low radius (where the rotation curve rises steeply) and in
these regions the ISM is mostly \ with accordingly high SFE. On the other
hand, the outer disks of spirals have 0 and a wide range of SFE.
Beyond basic relationship, it is unclear that has utility predicting
the SFE. In particular, we see no clear relationship between SFE and
where the ISM is mostly \ (magenta points). If collisions between bound
clouds regulate the SFE, we would expect an anti-correlation between
and SFE because cloud collisions are more frequent in the presence of greater
shear.

In dwarf galaxies increasing corresponds mostly to increasing SFE.
This relationship has the sense of the shear threshold proposed by
HUNTER98, that where rotation curves are nearly solid body low shear
allows clouds to form via instabilities aided by magnetic fields [see
also][]KIM01. The rotation curves in dwarf galaxies rise more slowly than
those in spirals, leading to > 0 over a larger range of radii in dwarf
galaxies and limiting = 0 to the relative outskirts of the galaxy. A
positive correlation between and SFE is opposite the sense expected if
cloud collisions are important: at high collisions should be less
frequent.

The decline in the SFE where the ISM is mostly \ is too dramatic to be
reproduced across our whole sample by changes in _ orb or
_ ff alone. This may be because at large radii a significant amount
of gas is simply unrelated to star formation. If the fraction of gas that is
unable to form GMCs increases with radius, the SFE will decline independent of
any change in GMC formation time. Here we consider the SFE as a function of
proposed star formation thresholds: gravitational instability in the gas alone
(Q_ gas), in a disk of gas and stars (Q_ stars+gas), the ability
of instabilities to develop before shear destroys them, and the ability of a
cold gas phase to form.

First we plot each threshold as a function of galactocentric radius in spiral
(Figure ) and dwarf galaxies (Figure
). Individual points correspond to averages over
10 --wide tilted rings. For magenta points _ H2 >
_ HI and for blue points _ H2 < _ HI. The
gray region in each plot shows the nominal condition for instability, i.e.,
where we expect star formation to occur. Red arrows indicate data outside the
range of the plot.

We proceed creating plots like Figure for each threshold and
comparing them to Figure . We expect supercritical gas
to exhibit a (dramatically) higher SFE than subcritical gas, where star
formation proceeds only in isolated pockets or not at all.

Figure shows SFE as a function of Q_ gas, Toomre's Q
parameter for a thin gas disk; the top left panels in Figures
and show Q_ gas as a
function of radius.

In each plot, a gray area indicates the theoretical condition for instability.
We see immediately that almost no area in our sample is formally unstable.
Rather, most lines of sight are strikingly stable, Q_ gas 4 is
typical inside 0.8~r_25 and Q_ gas > 10 is common.

We find no clear evidence for a Q_ gas threshold (at any value) that can
unambiguously distinguish regions with high SFE from those with low SFE. In
spirals, Q_ gas 2.5 appears to be a sufficient, but by no
means necessary condition for high SFE; there are also areas where the ISM is
mostly , SFE is quite high and Q_ gas 10. In dwarfs
Q_ gas appears, if anything, anti-correlated with SFE, though this may
partially result from incomplete estimates of _ gas.

These conclusions appear to contradict the findings by KENNICUTT89 and
MARTIN01, who found marginally stable gas (Q_ gas 1.5)
across the optical disk with a rise in Q_ gas corresponding to dropping
SFE at large radii. In fact, after correcting for different assumptions, our
median Q_ gas matches theirs quite well. Both KENNICUTT89 and
MARTIN01 assumed =2.8 10^20~ \ and
_ gas =6~km~s^-1, while we take =2.0
10^20~ \ and _ gas =11~km~s^-1. As a result, we
estimate less \ and more kinetic support than they do for the same
observations. If we match their assumptions, our median Q_ gas in
spirals and the outer parts of dwarfs agrees quite well with their threshold
value, though we find the central regions of dwarfs systematically above this
value [as did][]HUNTER98. We show this in Figures
, , and by
plotting the MARTIN01 threshold converted to our assumptions
(Q_ gas 3.9) as a a dashed line.

The main observational difference between our result and MARTIN01 is
that Q_ gas shows much more scatter in our analysis. As a result, a
systematic transition from low to high Q_ gas near the edge of the
optical disk is not a universal feature of our data, though a subset of spiral
galaxies do show increasing Q_ gas at large radii (Figure
).

This discrepancy in Q_ gas derived from similar data highlights the
importance of assumptions. The largest effect comes from _ gas,
which we measure to be 11~km~s^-1 and roughly constant in
--dominated outer disks (Appendix ). We assume _ gas
to be constant everywhere, an assumption that may break down on small scales
and in the molecular ISM. In this case we expect _ gas to be
locally lower than the average value, lowering Q_ gas and making gas
less stable. Black dots in the upper right panel of Figure
show the effect of changing _ gas from 11~km~s^-1 (our value)
to 6~km~s^-1 (the MARTIN01 value) and then to 3~km~s^-1,
the value expected and observed for a cold \ component
[e.g.][]YOUNG03, SCHAYE04, DEBLOK06. If most gas is cold then Q_
gas may easily be 1 for this component (if only a small
fraction of gas is cold, the situation is less clear).

Gravitational Instability Including Stars

Stars dominate the baryon mass budget over most of the areas we study and
stellar gravity may be expected to affect the stability of the gas disk. In
we described a straightforward extension of Q_
gas to the case of a disk containing gas and stars . In
Figure we plot SFE as a function of this parameter,
Q_ stars+gas, which we plot as a function of radius in the top right
panels of Figures and .

The gray region indicates where gas is unstable to axisymmetric collapse.
Including stars does not render large areas of our sample unstable, but it
does imply that most regions are only marginally stable, Q_ stars+gas
1.6. This in turn suggests that it is not so daunting to induce collapse
as one would infer from only Q_ gas.

In addition to lower values, Q_ stars+gas exhibits a much narrower
range of values than Q_ gas, mostly areas in both spiral and dwarf
galaxies show Q_ stars+gas = 1.3 -- 2.5. This may offer support to
the idea of self--regulated star formation, but it also means that Q_
stars+gas offers little leverage to predict the SFE. High SFE, mostly
molecular regions show the same Q_ stars+gas as low SFE regions from
outer disks (indeed, the highest values we observe come from the central parts
of spiral galaxies).

As with Q_ gas, our assumptions have a large impact on Q_
stars+gas. In addition to _ gas and (which affect the
calculation via Q_ gas), the stellar velocity dispersion, _*,
and mass--to--light ratio, , strongly affect our stability estimate. We
assume that _* _*^0.5 in order to yield a constant
stellar scale height. If we instead fixed _*, we would derive Q_
stars+gas increasing steadily with radius. Radial variations in may
create a similar effect.

BOISSIER03 find similar results to our own when they incorporate stars
in their stability analysis; they adopt a lower _ gas than we do,
but also lower \ and the effects roughly offset. YANG07 recently
derived Q_ stars+gas across the LMC and found widespread instability
that corresponded well with the distribution of star formation. If we match
their adopted _ gas (5~km~s^-1) and assumptions regarding
_* (constant at 15~km~s^-1) we also find widespread instability
throughout our dwarf subsample, Q_ stars+gas decreasing with radius; we
find a similar result for spirals if we fix a typical outer--disk _*.

Our approach is motivated by observations of disk galaxies (see Appendix
), but direct observations of _* at large radii are still
sorely needed.

Shear Threshold

SFE as a function of _
crit,A/ _ gas, the threshold for cloud growth in the presence
of shear for spiral (top row) and dwarf (bottom row)
galaxies. Conventions and symbols follow Figure . The gray
area shows where clouds should be able to survive distribution by shear.
figure*

If clouds form efficiently, e.g., through the aid of magnetic fields to
dissipate angular momentum, then HUNTER98 suggest that the time
available for a perturbation to grow in the presence of destructive shear may
limit where star formation is widespread. KIM01 describe a similar
scenario where magneto-Jeans instabilities can grow in regions with weak shear
or strong magnetic fields. In the bottom left panels of Figures
and , we plot this shear
threshold as a function of radius and in Figure we compare it
to the SFE.

The gray region shows the condition for instabilities to grow into GMCs,
_ crit,A / _ gas < 1. This matches the condition
Q_ gas < 1 where = 0, e.g., in outer disks of spirals. In the
inner parts of spirals and in dwarf galaxies, however, _ crit,A /
_ gas is lower than Q_ gas, i.e., the conditions for star
formation are more nearly supercritical (because shear is low in these
regions). These areas harbor \ or widespread star formation, so
supercritical values are expected.

This trend of more supercritical data at lower radii agrees with the steady
increase of SFE with decreasing radius that we saw in Figure .
However, the scatter in _ crit,A / _ gas < 1 is as
large as that in Q_ gas (as one would expect from their forms, see
Table ). As a result, a direct plot of SFE against _
crit,A / _ gas does not yield clear threshold behavior or a
strong correlation between _ crit,A / _ gas and SFE.
The strongest conclusion we can draw is that the inner parts of both spiral
and dwarf galaxies are marginally stable for the shear threshold (an
improvement over Q_ gas and Q_ stars+gas in these regions).

Cold Phase Formation

SFE as a function of _
S04/ _ gas, the threshold for the formation of a cold phase
SCHAYE04, for spiral (top row) and dwarf galaxies (bottom row).
Conventions and symbols follow Figure . The gray area
indicates where SCHAYE04 estimates that a cold phase can form. Most
areas where we observe star formation meet this criterion and the areas that
do not tend to have low SFE.
figure*

Even where the ISM is stable against gravitational collapse on large scales,
star formation may still proceed if a cold (narrow-line width) phase can form
locally and thus induce gravitational instability in a fraction of the gas
(recall the effect of lower _ gas in Figure ).
SCHAYE04 argued that this is the usual path to star formation in the
outer parts of galaxies and modeled the critical gas surface density for such
a phase to form, _ S04. The bottom right panels in Figures
and show _
S04/ _ gas as a function of radius and Figure
shows the SFE as a function of this ratio. The gray area in both figures shows
where a cold phase can form.

We calculate _ S04 from Equation , which depends on
I / [10^6~cm^-2~s^-1], the flux of ionizing photons. In outer disks,
we assume I = 10^6~cm^-2~s^-1, SCHAYE04's fiducial
value, and in inner disks we take I _ SFR,

I 10^6~ cm^-2~s^-1~ ( _ SFR5 10^4~ M_ ~
yr^-1~ kpc^-2 )~.

The normalization is the average _ SFR between
0.8--1.0~r_25 in our spiral subsample.

Equation also accounts for variations about
SCHAYE04's fiducial metallicity Z=0.1~Z_ , typical for the
outer disk of a spiral. We lack estimates of Z and so neglect this term but
note the sense of the uncertainty. Inner galaxy disks will tend to have higher
metallicities, which will lower _ S04. We already find
_ gas > _ S04 over most inner disks; therefore missing
Z seems unlikely to seriously bias our results.

Figures , , and
show that we expect a cold phase over most of the disk in
both spiral and dwarf galaxies. In our spiral subsample, most data inside
r_ gal 0.9~r_25 meet this criterion. Because most subcritical
data come from large radii, we also find that most lines of sight with
_ gas < _ S04 exhibit low SFEs or upper limits.

Because most data are supercritical, the threshold is of
limited utility for predicting the SFE within a galaxy disk.
SCHAYE04 does not predict the ratio of --to-- \ where cold gas
forms; he is primarily concerned with the edges of galaxies. Figures
and broadly confirm that his
proposed threshold matches both the edge of the optical disk and the typical
threshold found by MARTIN01.

This relevance of this comparison to the SFE within the optical disk is that
based on the SCHAYE04 model, we expect a widespread narrow--line phase
throughout most of our galaxies [][obtain a similar result for the Milky
Way]WOLFIRE03. This suggests that cold phase formation followed by collapse
may be a common path to star formation and offers a way to form stars in our
otherwise stable disks.

Discussion

In , and we
examined the SFE as a function of basic physical parameters, laws, and
thresholds. Here we collect these results into general conclusions
regarding the SFE in galaxies and identify key elements of a
successful theory of star formation in galaxies.

figure*

Using a data set that overlaps the one presented here, BIGIEL08 found
a linear relationship between _ SFR and _ H2. Here
we extend that finding: Where the ISM is mostly \ in spiral
galaxies, the SFE does not vary strongly with any of the quantities that we
consider, including radius, _ gas, _ *, P_
h, _ orb, and . We plot SFE~( ) as a function of
each of these quantities in Figure . The median value for tilted
rings from our spiral subsample is _10 SFE~( ) = -9.28
0.17, i.e.,


SFE~( )~= 5.25 2.5 10^-10~
yr^-1~.

Constant SFE~( ) might be expected if 1) conditions within a GMC, rather
than the larger scale properties of the ISM, drive star formation
[e.g.,][]KRUMHOLZ05 and 2) GMC properties are relatively universal
rather than, e.g., a sensitive function of formation mechanism or environment.
This appears to be the case in the inner Milky Way (excluding the Galactic
center) and in M31 and M33, where GMC properties are largely a function of
cloud mass alone
[][]SOLOMON87,ROSOLOWSKY03,ROSOLOWSKY07,BLITZ07,BOLATTO08. The
constancy of SFE~( ) hints that a similar case holds in our spiral
subsample.

Figure illustrates why (relatively) universal GMC properties
may be plausible in our sample. From Equation , the internal
pressure of a starless GMC with _ gas
170~M_ ~pc^-2 [][]SOLOMON87 is P_ h/k_ B
10^6~ K~cm^-3. This is the highest value we plot in Figures
and and only a small fraction of our data have
higher P_ h so that even where the ISM is mostly , P_ h is
usually well below the typical internal pressure of a GMC. Thus GMCs are not
necessarily pressure-confined, which allows the possibility of bound, isolated
GMCs out of pressure equilibrium with the rest of the ISM. In this case, the
environmental factors that we consider may never be communicated to GMCs
(though some mechanism may still be needed to damp out any imprint left by
environment during GMC formation).

The range of P_ h in our sample also underscores that one should not
expect a constant SFE~( ) to extend to starburst conditions, where
P_ h and _ gas on kiloparsec scales exceed those found for
individual Galactic GMCs and SFE~( ) is observed to vary strongly
with local conditions [e.g.,][]KENNICUTT98A,RIECHERS07.

Another important caveat is that the distribution of GMC masses is observed to
vary with environment , possibly as a result of varying
formation mechanisms. This suggests that either the SFE of a GMC is only a
weak function of its mass (and thus other properties) or that real variations
in SFE~( ) may exist in dwarf galaxies and the outskirts of spirals.

Conditions at the -to-- \ Transition in Spirals

In spiral galaxies, the transition between an --dominated ISM and a
mostly-- \ ISM occurs at a characteristic value for most quantities. This
can be seen from Figures , , ,
, and , in which -dominated regions (blue
points) typically occupy one region and -dominated regions (magenta
points) occupy another.

Table gives our estimates of properties where _
HI _ H2 in spiral galaxies. For each galaxy, we measure
the median of the property in question over all pixels where _ H2
= 0.8 -- 1.2~ _ HI. Table lists the median
transition value in our spiral subsample, along with the (1 ) scatter
and log scatter among galaxies. These values appear as dotted vertical lines
in Figures , , , ,
and . Note that methodology --- the choice to use pixels or
rings, to interpolate, use the mean or median, etc. --- affects the values in
Table by 20\

From Table , we find that physical conditions at the
--to-- \ transition are fairly similar to those found in the solar
neighborhood. The orbital time is 1.8 10^8~years and the
free--fall time in the gas disk is 4.2 10^7~years. The
midplane gas pressure is P_ h / k_ B 2.3
10^4~cm^-3~K, corresponding to a particle density n 1~cm^-3.
The baryon mass budget in the disk is dominated by stars, _*
81~M_ ~pc^-2 while _ gas
14~M_ ~pc^-2. Accordingly, the gas is stable against large scale
gravitational collapse on its own (Q_ gas 3.8), but in the
presence of stars is only marginally stable Q_ stars+gas 1.6.

H_2 in Dwarf Galaxies

Because of uncertainties in , we do not directly estimate the amount of
\ in dwarf galaxies . However, indirect evidence suggests that a
significant part of the ISM is \ in the central parts of these galaxies.
Specifically, we observe very high SFE in the centers of dwarf galaxies ---
higher than SFE~( ) in spirals --- often under conditions associated with
an -dominated ISM in spirals ( ). It would be
surprising if the SFE of \ in dwarfs indeed exceeds SFE~( ) in
spirals. We argue that an unaccounted--for reservoir of \ is a more
likely explanation.

The SFE~( ) that we observe in spiral galaxies offers an approximate way
to estimate how much \ may be present. If we assume that SFE~( ) is
the same in dwarf and spiral galaxies then we can calculate _ H2
from the observed _ SFR via


_ H2 10^-6~ _ SFR5.25 10^-10~ yr^-1~.

This treatment suggests that in our typical dwarf galaxies, most of the ISM is
\ within 0.25~r_25. This may be seen directly from Equation
, which translates our fit of SFE to radius to a relation
between R_ mol and radius assuming Equation . From
Equation , _ H2 / _ HI in dwarf
galaxies is 1--2 inside 0.25~r_25, rising as high as 3 at
r_ gal = 0.

Where the ISM is --dominated --- in dwarf galaxies and outside the
-to- \ transition in spirals --- the SFE declines steadily with increasing
radius. In this regime, the SFE is covariant with a number of environmental
factors, including _*, pressure, density, free fall time, and orbital
timescale. This observation, together with those in
and , implies that while star formation within GMCs is
largely decoupled from environment, the formation of H_2 / GMCs from
\ depends sensitively on local conditions.

In this case, we can break the SFE into two parts: star formation
within GMCs and GMC formation, so that


SFE = SFE ( H_2
) _ H2 _ gas = SFE (
H_2 ) R_ molR_ mol+1~,

i.e., the SFE is a product of a constant SFE ( ) and R_
mol = _ H2/ _ HI, which is a function of local
conditions.

We show this directly in Figure and plot the same data,
binned, in Figure . We plot R_ mol = _
H2/ _ HI on the y-axis as a function of radius, _*,
P_ h ( _ ff^-2), and _ orb. Red points
show direct measurements of R_ mol from CO and \ assembled following
the methodology used by BLITZ06 to compute R_ mol as a function
of P_ h:

enumerate
For each galaxy, we examine scatter plots to estimate a value of P_
h above which our pixel-by-pixel measurements of _ H2 are
approximately complete.
Where P_ h is above this limit, we measure R_ mol for each
pixel.
We sort pixels into bins based on P_ h and calculate the average
and scatter in _10 R_ mol for the pixels in each bin.
enumerate

A red point in Figure corresponds to one P_ h
bin in one spiral galaxy; the x-- and y--error bars indicate the width of
the bin and the scatter in R_ mol within the bin. We carry out
analogous procedures to compute R_ mol as a function of r_ gal,
_*, and _ orb.

Because of the limited sensitivity of the CO data, these direct measurements
of R_ mol seldom probe far below R_ mol = 1 and do not extend to
dwarfs. Therefore we also use _ SFR and _ HI to
estimate R_ mol by assuming a fixed SFE ( ). For each tilted
ring in both subsamples, we convert _ SFR into _ H2
using Equation . We divide this by the observed _
HI to estimate R_ mol for that ring. We plot the results as green
points for spirals and purple points for dwarf galaxies Because
P_ h depends on _ gas, we make a first--order correction
to P_ h in dwarf galaxies based on the estimated R_ mol..
This approach --- essentially plotting SFE~( ) in units of R_ mol
--- allows us to estimate R_ mol far below the sensitivity of our CO
maps. While this extrapolation of SFE~( ) may be aggressive, the
quantity _ SFR / _ HI must be closely related to the
ability of \ to assemble into star--forming clouds.

Figure shows the data in Figure binned by the
quantity on the x-axis. Thin dashed lines horizontal show R_ mol = 1,
i.e., _ HI = _ H2, and the value of the property on
the x-axis that we estimate at the --to-- \ transition (
and Table ). Dashed and dotted lines show
fits and expectations that we discuss later in this section.

In spirals, the agreement between direct measurements of R_ mol and
estimates based on _ SFR and _ HI is quite good.
There is also general agreement between spirals and dwarf galaxies: the two
subsamples sweep out similar, though slightly offset, trends in all four
panels. The magnitude of the offsets between dwarf and spiral galaxies that we
see in Figure , typically 0.2--0.3~dex, offers indirect
evidence that differences between the subsamples --- metallicity, radiation fields,
spiral structure ( ) --- affect cloud formation or SFE
( ) at the factor of 2--3 level.

Figures and show explictly what we have
already seen indirectly throughout . R_ mol is a
continuous function of environment spanning from the --dominated
(R_ mol 10) to --dominated (R_ mol 0.1) ISM, from
inner to outer galaxy disks, and over a wide range of ISM pressures. This
qualitatively confirms and extends similar findings by WONG02 and
BLITZ06, which were mostly confined to the inner, molecule--dominated
parts of spirals.

Cloud Formation Timescales

In , we discuss two basic ways that R_ mol
might be set by environment. First, the timescale to form GMCs may depend on
local conditions. If \ and \ are in approximate equilibrium, with the
entire neutral ISM actively cycling between these two phases, then

R_ mol = _ H2 _ HI
GMC~lifetime (
)~.

For constant GMC lifetimes --- perhaps a reasonable extension of
fixed SFE~( ) --- R_ mol is set by (
). In and
we saw that SFE anti-correlates with _ ff and
_ orb where _ HI > _ H2. If GMCs form over
these timescales then R_ mol _ ff^-1 or R_ mol
_ orb^-1.

However, we found that the SFE decreased more steeply than one
would expect if these timescales alone dictated R_ mol, so that
increasing timescale for GMC formation cannot explain all of the decline in
R_ mol. Figures and show this directly:
dotted lines in the bottom two panels illustrate R_ mol
_ ff^-1 and R_ mol _ orb^-1. In both
cases the prediction is notably shallower than the data in both the \ and
--dominated regimes.

Disk Stability Thresholds

Of course, the entire ISM may not participate in cloud formation. Star
formation thresholds are often invoked to explain the decrease in SFE between
inner and outer galaxy disks. The amount of stable, warm \ may depend on
environment, with a variable fraction of the disk actively cycling between
\ and GMCs. This suggests a straightforward extension of Equation
,

R_ mol = _ H2 _ HI
GMC~lifetime (
) f_ GMC~forming~,

which again balances GMC formation and destruction but now includes
the factor f_ GMC~forming to represent the fact that only a fraction of
the \ is actively cycling between the molecular and atomic ISM.

We considered three thresholds in which large--scale instabilities dictate
f_ GMC~forming --- Q_ gas, Q_ stars+gas, and shear. One
would naively expect these thresholds to correspond to f_ GMC~forming
1 for supercritical gas and f_ GMC~forming 1 for subcritical
gas, yielding a step function in SFE or R_ mol. However, we do not
observe such relationships between thresholds and SFE (
), which agrees with BOISSIER07 who also based
their SFR profiles on extinction-corrected FUV maps and found no evidence for
sharp star formation cutoffs.

If these instabilities regulate star formation but operate below our
resolution, we still expect a correspondence between SFE and the average
threshold value, which should indicate what fraction of the ISM is unstable.
Despite this expectation, Q_ gas shows little correspondence to the SFE
and almost all of our sample is stable against axisymmetric collapse.
KIM01 and KIM07 discuss Q_ gas thresholds for the
growth of non-axisymmetric instabilities, but these are in the range Q_
gas 1--2, still lower than the typical values that we observe (
). Even independent of the normalization, Q_ gas shows
little relation to the SFE, particularly in dwarf galaxies [see
also][]HUNTER98,WONG02,BOISSIER03.

Including the effects of stellar gravity reduces stability. Over most of our
sample, Q_ stars+gas 2 with a much narrower range than Q_
gas [similar improvements were seen by][]BOISSIER03,YANG07. These
values are roughly consistent with the conditions for cloud formation found
from simulations. LI05 find gas collapses where Q_ stars+gas
1.6 and KIM01,KIM07 find runaway instabilities where Q_
gas 1.4 [though this is Q_ gas and not Q_
stars+gas; for a region like the solar neighborhood,][argue that disk
thickness, which tends to increase stability, approximately offsets the effect
of stars on Q]KIM07.

Q_ stars+gas increases towards the central parts of spirals, so that
although the ISM in these regions is usually dominated by , they appear
more stable than gas near the --to-- \ transition. HUNTER98
and KIM01 suggest that because of low shear, instabilities aided by
magnetic fields may grow in these regions despite supercritical Q.
Comparing to the shear threshold proposed by HUNTER98, we find some
support for this idea: at 0.2~r_25 many dwarf and spiral galaxies
appear unstable or marginally stable. As with Q_ gas, however,
_ crit,A/ _ gas shows large scatter and no clear
ability to predict the SFE.

Thus, we find no clear evidence that disk stability at large scales drives the
observed variations in SFE and R_ mol. Improved handling of
second--order effects (disk thickness, _ gas, , _*,
and ) may change this picture, but comparing our first--order analysis to
expectations and simulations, disks appear marginally stable more or less
throughout with little correlation between proposed thresholds and SFE.

Cold Phase Formation

Timescales and thresholds computed at 400 (dwarfs) and 800~pc (spirals)
scales do not offer a simple way to predict R_ mol. An alternative view
is that physics on smaller scales regulates cloud formation. Comparison with
models by SCHAYE04 suggests that a cold phase can form across the
entire disk of most of our sample, which agrees with results from
WOLFIRE03 modeling our own Galaxy. High density, narrow--linewidth
clouds may easily be unstable or be rendered so by the passage of spiral arms
or supernova shocks, even where the ISM as a whole is subcritical. Both
SCHAYE04 and DEBLOK06 have emphasized the effect of lower
_ gas on instability and we have seen that a shift from the
observed _ gas = 11~km~s^-1 to _ gas =
3~km~s^-1 would render most gas disks in our sample unstable or
marginally stable (of course a proper calculation requires estimating the
density and fraction of the mass in this phase as well).

A narrow--line component is observed from high--velocity resolution \
observations of nearby irregular galaxies , but an
important caveat is the lack of direct evidence for such a component in
THINGS. With 2.5 or 5~km~s^-1 velocity resolution, one cannot
distinguish a narrow component directly. Therefore, USERO08 followed
up on work by BRAUN97, who used the peak intensity along each line of
sight to estimate the maximum contribution from a cold phase and found
pervasive networks of high brightness filaments. USERO08 find no clear
evidence for a cold phase traced by networks of high brightness filaments,
suggesting that a cold phase, if present, is mixed with the warm phase at the
THINGS resolution of several times 100~pc.

Despite this caveat, our results offer significant circumstantial support
that ISM physics below our resolution dictates R_ mol: the lack of
obvious threshold behavior, marginal stability of our disks, the ability of a
cold phase to form, and the continuous variations in SFE and R_ mol as
a function of radius, _*, and P_ h.

In particular, the relationship between R_ mol and P_ h has
been studied before. Following theoretical work by ELMEGREEN93 and
ELMEGREEN94, WONG02 and BLITZ06 showed that R_
mol and P_ h correlate in nearby spiral galaxies (mostly at
R_ mol > 1) and ROBERTSON08 recently produced a similar
relationship from simulations that include cool gas and photodissociation of
; they emphasize the importance of the latter to reproduce the observed
scaling.

The dash-dotted line in the bottom left panel of Figure shows
R_ mol P_ h^1.2, predicted by ELMEGREEN93 from
balancing \ formation and destruction in a model ISM. This is a
reasonable description of dwarf galaxies, where we derive a best--fit power
law with index 1.05. Spirals show a slightly shallower relation
between R_ mol and P_ h with best--fit power law index
0.80. The thick dashed line in the bottom left panel of Figure
shows our best fit to the spiral subsample (both CO/ \ and
SFR/ ) over the range R_ mol = 0.1 -- 10. Table
lists this fit along with fits to dwarf galaxies and the results of
WONG02 and BLITZ06.

The entry ``spiral subsample (combined)'' in Table lists
the best fit power law like Equation for our spiral
subsample. This fit has an index = 0.80 and normalization
_10 P_0 / k_ B = 4.23 (this is an OLS bisector fit over the
range 0.1 < R_ mol < 10 giving equal weight to each of the red and
green points in Figure ). Formally, the uncertainty in the
fit is small because it includes a large number of data points. However, both
_10 P_0 / k_ B and scatter by several tenths when fit
to individual galaxies. This agrees well with =0.8 derived by
WONG02 and with = 0.92 0.07 obtained by BLITZ06
given the uncertainties. Fitting the dwarf subsample in the same manner
yields _10 P_0 / k_ B = 4.51, the pressure at the
--to-- \ transition. This is 0.2--0.3~dex higher than _10 P_0
/ k_ B = 4.23 in spirals, suggesting that at the same pressure
(density) GMC/ \ formation in our dwarf subsample is a factor of 2
less efficient than in spirals.

R_ mol and Environment

The fits between R_ mol and P_ h in Table are
reasonable descriptions of the data, but do not represent a ``smoking gun''
regarding the underlying physics; radius, _*, P_ h, and
_ orb are all covariant and each could be used to predict R_
mol with reasonable accuracy in spirals. Therefore we close our discussion
by noting a set of four scaling relations between R_ mol and
environment that describe our spiral subsample

R_ mol &=& 10.6~ (-r_ gal /
0.21~r_25 )~
R_ mol &=& _* / 81~M_ ~ pc^-2
R_ mol &=& ( P_ h / 1.7 10^4~ cm^-3~
K~k_ B )^0.8
R_ mol &=& ( _ orb / 1.8 10^8~ yr )^-2.0

these appear as thick dashed lines in Figure .

In particular, we stress the relationship between R_ mol and _*
(see also Figure ). This has several possible interpretations,
the most simple of which is that stars form where they have formed in the
past. There are physical reasons to think relationship may be causal, however.
Considering a similar finding in dwarf irregular galaxies, HUNTER98
suggested that stellar feedback may play a critical role in triggering cloud
formation. Recently the importance of the stellar potential well has been
highlighted, either to triggering large-scale instabilities
or in bringing gas to high densities in order for
small-scale physics to operate more effectively
.

A Note on Systematics: , _ gas,
_*,

In this paper, we work ``to first order,'' using the simplest
well-motivated assumptions to convert observations to physical
quantities. These assumptions are described in and
Appendices -- . These are not always unique
and here we note differences with the literature and the effect that
they may have on our analysis.

: In spirals, we adopt a fixed = 2 10^20~
. WONG02 and BLITZ06 adopt the same value.
KENNICUTT89, KENNICUTT98A, MARTIN01, and
KENNICUTT07 also use a fixed value, but a slightly higher one, =
2.8 10^20~ . BOISSIER03 test the effects of a
metallicity--dependent \ that tends to yield lower _ H2 than
our values in the inner parts of spirals, but higher in the outer parts.

Variations in the normalization of \ will affect the location of the
--to-- \ transition and the value of SFE~( ), but not the
observations of fixed SFE~( ) or steadily varying R_ mol. A strong
dependence of \ on environment in spirals would affect many of our
results, but leave the basic observation of environment--dependent SFE~( )
intact. Variations in the CO J=2 1/1 0 line ratio
(Appendix ) will manifest as changes in .

_ gas: We adopt _ gas = 11~km~s^-1 based
on the THINGS second moment maps (Appendix ). This is almost twice
the commonly used _ gas = 6~km~s^-1
and also higher than
_ gas = 8~km~s^-1, adopted by BLITZ06. We emphasize
the importance of _ gas to the stability analysis in
; observations with velocity and spatial resolution capable of
distenangling different \ components and a multi--phase analysis are needed
to move forward on this topic.

_ *: We assume an isothermal stellar disk with a fixed
scale height, as do BOISSIER03 and BLITZ06. WONG02 and
YANG07 assume a fixed stellar velocity dispersion. This has a moderate
effect on P_ h and a strong effect on Q_ stars+gas (
).

: We adopt = 0.5 (Appendix ), consistent
with our adopted IMF and BELL03A, the same value used by
BLITZ04,BLITZ06. directly affects _*, P_ h,
_ ff, and Q_ stars+gas. It may vary by 30\
within and among galaxies , with larger variations in the bluest
galaxies or from changes to the assumed IMF .

Star formation rate tracer: We use FUV+24 to estimate recent
_ SFR, discussed in detail in Appendix . This is
similar to BOISSIER07 but in contrast to KENNICUTT89,
KENNICUTT98A, MARTIN01, WONG02, and
BOISSIER03, who each used H emission with various extinction
corrections. BOISSIER07 considered differences between between
H and FUV profiles in detail, suggesting that stochasticity leads
H to show signs of knees and turnoffs while FUV remains smooth. We
work pixel--by--pixel and in radial profile [similar
to][]MARTIN01,WONG02,BOISSIER03,BLITZ06 rather than attempting to isolate
individual star forming regions [e.g.,][]KENNICUTT07. Both differences
mean that we measure ``recent'' rather than ``present'' _ SFR,
which may account for some of the smoothness in the trends seen in
.

Star Formation Recipes

How we predict _ SFR, illustrated for
NGC~3184. We calculate the threshold value ( left, here Q_
stars+gas), identify supercritical areas (solid contour). In parallel,
we estimate R_ mol = _ H2 / _ HI (
middle), here from R_ mol _ ff^-1. We combine
these with the assumption of a fixed SFE ( ) and a (fixed) low SFE in
subcritical areas to predict _ SFR ( right).
figure*

As a final exercise, we compare our galaxies to simple star formation recipes
based on the laws and thresholds discussed in 2 and normalized to the
--to-- \ transition in spirals ( ). We predict the SFE
in this way:

enumerate
We assume SFE ( )= 5.25 10^-10~ yr^-1
We calculate R_ mol = _ H2 / _ HI either:

By setting R_ mol = _ ff,0 / _ ff or _
orb,0 / _ orb.
From our fits of R_ mol to radius, _*, P_ h, and
_ orb in spirals galaxies (Equation ).
enumerate

We derive _ SFR from SFE~( ), R_ mol,
and _ HI.

We calculate the predicted SFE, dividing _ SFR by
_ gas in spirals and _ HI in dwarf
galaxies.

We combine R_ mol _ ff^-1 or _
orb^-1 with thresholds. In subcritical areas, we set SFE~=5
10^-11~yr^-1, roughly the observed value at r_25 in both
subsamples.
enumerate

Figure illustrates the procedure for R_ mol
_ ff^-1 and the Q_ stars+gas threshold in the
spiral galaxy NGC~3184.

We set _ ff,0 and _ orb,0 equal to the timescale at the
--to-- \ transition in spirals ( , Table
), i.e., we predict R_ mol using the dotted lines in
Figure . The predictions will therefore intersect our data
where R_ mol = _ H2/ _ HI 1 in spirals.

We adopt the same approach to normalize thresholds. For shear and Q_
stars+gas, we define the boundary between supercritical and subcritical
data as 2.3 and 1.6, respectively, approximately the values at the
--to-- \ transition in spirals. For the SCHAYE04 cold phase
threshold we use a critical value of 1.

We implement thresholds pixel--by--pixel and present our results in radial
average. Within a tilted ring, some lines of sight can be supercritical and
some can be subcritical, allowing the threshold to damp the average SFE in a
ring without setting it to the minimum value.

The choice to normalize the recipes for both dwarf and spiral galaxies using
values measured for spirals is meant to highlight differences between the
subsamples.

Comparison of predicted (color bins) to observed
(gray region) SFE in spiral ( left) and dwarf ( right) galaxies.
We adopt fixed SFE~( ) and predict R_ mol from _
ff^-1 ( top row) and _ orb^-1 ( middle panel)
combined with thresholds. We also show four fits of R_ mol to other
quantities in spirals ( bottom row). The dotted horizontal line in the
top two rows shows the SFE that we adopt for subcritical data.
figure*

Figure shows the results of these calculations. The observed
SFE as a function of radius appears as a shaded gray region (based on Figure
). Radial profiles of SFE compiled from predictions appear in
color (these follow the same methodology used to make the bins in Figure
). The top row shows results for spiral ( left) and dwarf
( right) galaxies setting R_ mol _ ff^-1
combined with several thresholds, the middle row shows results for R_
mol _ orb^-1 combined with the same stable of
thresholds, and the bottom row shows R_ mol set by fits to radius,
_*, P_ h, and _ orb.

Figure illustrates much of what we saw in
and . First, adopting fixed SFE~(
) ensures that we match the observed SFE with reasonable accuracy in the inner
parts of spirals regardless of how we predict R_ mol. Using fits to
predict R_ mol (bottom row) offers a small refinement over the
timescales in this regime, but as long as R_ mol 1 then SFE
SFE~( ). As a result, the available gas reservoir sets the SFR
in this regime.

Setting R_ mol _ ff^-1 or _ orb^-1
smoothly damps the SFE with increasing radius, but not by enough to match
observations. Without a threshold, _ ff and _ orb
overpredict the SFE at large radii in spiral galaxies and at r
0.4~r_25 in dwarf galaxies (black bins, top two rows).

Thresholds damp the SFE with mixed success (green, magenta, and blue bins in
the top two panels). Each somewhat lowers the SFE in the outer parts of
galaxies. In the process, however, both Q_ stars+gas and shear predict
suppressed star formation at low or intermediate radii in both dwarf and
spiral galaxies, areas where we observe ongoing star formation (the vertical
error bars show that the 50\
in both cases). We saw in that the radial variation
in these thresholds is often less than the scatter among galaxies at a given
radius and that the step function behavior that we implement here is not clear
in our data.

The SCHAYE04 threshold predicts that a cold phase can form almost
everywhere in our sample and so only comes into play in the outer parts of
spirals and in dwarf galaxies, where it damps the predicted SFE, but not by
enough to match observations.

The bottom left panel shows that the fits mostly do a good job of reproducing
the SFE in spirals, which is expected because they are fits to these data.

The same fits (to spirals) yield mixed results when applied to dwarf galaxies.
The fits to _* and _ orb show very large scatter and fits
to radius, P_ h, and _ orb all overpredict SFE by varying
amounts (similar discrepancies are evident comparing spirals and dwarfs in the
top two panels). The scaling relations relating R_ mol to environment
in spirals apparently do not apply perfectly to dwarfs. Likely drivers for the
discrepancy are the lower abundance of metals and dust and more intense
radiation fields, which affect phase balance in the ISM and the rate of \
formation and destruction. Focusing on the pressure fit (green), we can phrase
the observation this way: for the same pressure (density), cloud formation in
our dwarf subsample is suppressed relative to that in spirals by a factor of
2.

Summary

We combine THINGS, SINGS, the GALEX NGS, HERACLES, and BIMA SONG to study what
sets the star formation efficiency in 12 nearby spirals and 11 nearby dwarf
galaxies.

We use these data to estimate the star formation rate surface density, gas
kinematics, and the mass surface densities of , , and stars
(Appendices and ). To trace recent star formation,
we use a linear combination of GALEX FUV and Spitzer 24 (Appendix
). We suggest that this combination represent a useful tool given
the outstanding legacy data sets now available from these two observatories
(e.g., SINGS and the GALEX NGS).

We focus on the star formation efficiency (SFE), _ SFR /
_ gas, and the -to- \ ratio, R_ mol. These
quantities remove the basic scaling between gas and SFR, allowing us to focus
on where gas forms stars quickly/efficiently (SFE) and the phase of the
neutral ISM (R_ mol). We measure the SFE out to 1.2~r_25,
compare it to a series of variables posited to influence star formation, and
test the ability of several predictions to reproduce the observed SFE.

Structure of Our Typical Spiral and Dwarf Galaxy

We deliberately avoid discussing individual galaxies in the main text (these
data appear in Appendices and ). Instead, we
study ``stacked'' versions of a spiral and dwarf galaxy. We sketch their basic
structure here.

The spiral galaxy has a roughly constant distribution of , _
HI 6~M_ ~pc^-2 out to r_25. \ surface
densities seldom exceed _ HI 10~M_ ~pc^-2; gas
in excess of this surface density tends to be molecular. We observe no
analogous saturation in _ H2, finding _ H2
100~M_ ~pc^-2 in the very central parts of many galaxies.

Molecular gas, star formation, and stellar surface density all decline with
nearly equal exponential scale lengths, 0.2~r_25, giving the
appearance of a long--lived star--forming disk embedded in a sea of . The
ISM is mostly \ within 0.5~r_25 and where _*
80~M_ .

Over a wide range of conditions the SFR per unit H_2, SFE ( ), =5.25
2.5 10^-10~yr^-1 at scales of 800~pc. This is a ``limiting
efficiency'' in the sense that we do not observe the average SFE in spirals to
climb above this value. Where the ISM is mostly , the SFE is lower than
this limiting value and declines radially with an exponential scale length
0.2--0.25~r_25. In this regime, the star formation rate per unit
stellar mass remains nearly fixed at a value about twice the cosmologically
average rate (i.e., the stellar assembly time is twice the Hubble
time).

Dwarf galaxies also exhibit flat \ distributions, declining SFE with
increasing radius, and a nearly constant stellar assembly time. Normalized to
r_25, the scale length of the decline in the SFE is identical to that
observed in spirals within the uncertainties. The stellar assembly time is
half that found in spirals, corresponding to roughly a Hubble time. Dwarfs
exhibit only the crudest relationship between _ SFR and
_ HI and, as a result, _* is a much better predictor of
the SFR than _ gas [in good agreement with][]HUNTER98.
The lack of a clear relationship between _ SFR and _
gas is at least partially due to an incomplete census of the ISM:
conditions in the central parts of dwarf galaxies often match those where we
find \ in spirals and in these same regions the SFE is (unexpectedly)
higher than we observe anywhere in spirals (where \ is included).

Conclusions for Specific Laws and Thresholds

We compare the observed SFE to proposed star formation laws and thresholds
described in . For star formation laws we find:

itemize

The SFE varies dramatically over a small range of _ HI and
very little with changing _ H2. Therefore, the disk
free-fall time for a fixed scale height disk or any other weak dependence
of SFE on _ gas is of little use to predict the SFE (
).

The disk free-fall time accounting for a changing scale height,
_ ff, correlates with both SFE and R_ mol (
). Setting SFE proportional to _ ff broadly
captures the drop in SFE in spirals, but predicts variations in SFE~( )
that we do not observe and is a poor match to dwarf galaxies. Taking
_ ff to be the relevant timescale for \ to form GMCs (i.e.,
R_ mol _ ff^-1), fails to capture the full drop in
the SFE in either subsample.

The orbital timescale, _ orb, also correlates with both
SFE and R_ mol, but in outer spirals and dwarf galaxies both SFE and
R_ mol drop faster than _ orb increases (
). As with _ ff, _ orb alone cannot
describe cloud or star formation in our sample.

In spirals, we observe no clear relationship between SFE~( ) and
the logarithmic derivative of the rotation curve, (
). In dwarf galaxies, SFE correlates with . Both
observations are contrary to the anti-correlation between SFE and
expected if cloud--cloud collisions set the SFE .

Fixed GMC efficiency appears to be a good description of our
spiral subsample [ and][]BIGIEL08. SFE ( )
is constant as a function of a range of environmental parameters. This
observation applies only to the disks of spiral galaxies, not starbursts or
low metallicity dwarf galaxies.

We observe a correspondence between hydrostatic pressure and ISM
phase ( and ). In spirals our
results are consistent with previous work . In dwarf
galaxies and the outer parts of spirals, inferring R_ mol from
SFE~( ) yields results roughly consistent with predictions by
ELMEGREEN93.
itemize

For thresholds we find:

itemize
Despite a suggestion of increased stability at large radii in spirals,
there is no clear relation between Q_ gas --- which measures
stability against axisymmetric collapse due to self-gravity in the gas
disk alone --- and SFE. Most regions are quite stable and Q_ gas
has large scatter, even appearing weakly anti--correlated with the SFE
in dwarfs ( ).

When the effects of stars are included, most disks are only marginally
stable: Q_ stars+gas , which measures
gravitational instability in a disk of gas and stars, lies mostly in the
narrow range 1.3--2.5, increasing slightly towards the centers and edges
of galaxies. We emphasize that adopted parameters --- , _
gas, , and _* --- strongly affect both Q_ gas and
Q_ stars+gas ( ).

The ability of instabilities to survive competition with shear
shows the same large scatter and high stability as Q_
gas in the outer disks of spirals, but identifies most areas in dwarf
galaxies and inner spirals as only marginally stable, an improvement over
Q_ gas ( ).

Most areas in both dwarf and spiral galaxies meets the condition needed
for a cold phase to form ( ) .
Regions that do not meet this criterion tend to come from outer disks and
have low SFE. Because this criterion is met over such a large area, it is of
little use on its own to predict variation in the SFE within galaxy disks.
itemize

Finally, we distinguish three different critical surface densities.
First, in spirals _ gas 14~M_ ~pc^-2 at the
-to- \ transition. We find no evidence that this is a real threshold for
cloud formation: R_ mol = _ H2/ _ HI varies
continuously across R_ mol = 1 as a function of other quantities.
However, it is useful to predict the SFE, which will be nearly constant above
this _ gas. A related (but not identical) value, _ HI
10~M_ ~pc^-2, is the surface density at which \
``saturates.'' Gas in excess of this surface density is in the molecular phase
[][]MARTIN01,WONG02,BIGIEL08. This presumably drives the observation
that most vigorous star formation takes place where _ HI
10~M_ ~pc^-2 [e.g.,][]SKILLMAN87. Last, lower values,
_ gas 3--4~M_ ~pc^-2
[e.g.][]KENNICUTT89,SCHAYE04, may correspond to the edge of the
star--forming disk. At our resolution such values are relatively rare inside
1.2~r_25 and we draw no conclusion regarding whether this ``outer disk
threshold'' corresponds to a real shift in the mode of star formation.

General Conclusions

Our general conclusions are:

enumerate

In the disks of spiral galaxies, the SFE of \ is roughly constant
as a function of: galactocentric radius, _*, _ gas,
P_ h, _ orb, Q_ gas, and (
). This fixed SFE~( )=5.25 2.5
10^-10~yr^-1 ( _ Dep ( H2) = 1.9 10^9~yr) sets
the SFE of total gas across the --dominated inner parts (r_ gal
0.5~r_25) of spiral galaxies.

In spiral galaxies, the transition between a mostly-- \ and a
mostly-- \ ISM is a well--defined function of local conditions (
). It occurs at a characteristic radius (0.43
0.18~r_25), _* (81 25~M_ ~pc^-2), _
gas (14 6~M_ ~pc^-2), P_ h (2.3 1.5
10^4~k_ B~cm^-3~K), and _ orb (1.8 0.4
10^8~yr).

We find indirect evidence for abundant \ in the central parts of
many dwarf galaxies, where SFE~( ) exceeds SFE ( ) found in spirals.
The simplest explanation is that \ accounts for a significant fraction
of the ISM along these lines of sight ( and
). The implied central _ H2/ _ HI
is 2.5 with _ H2 = _ HI at
0.25~r_25.

Where _ HI > _ H2 --- in the outer parts of
spirals and throughout dwarf galaxies (by assumption) --- we observe the SFE
to decline steadily with increasing radius, with scale length
0.2--0.25~r_25 in both subsamples ( ). We also
observe a decline in SFE with decreasing _*, decreasing P_ h,
and increasing _ orb, which are all covariant with radius.

Where _ HI > _ H2, we find little relation
between SFE and _ gas ( ) but a strong
relationship between SFE and _* ( ). The
simplest explanation is that present day star formation roughly follows past
star formation. A more aggressive interpretation is that the stellar
potential well or feedback are critical to bring gas to high densities.

The --to-- \ ratio, R_ mol= _ H2/ _
HI, and by extension cloud formation, depends strongly on environment.
R_ mol correlates with radius, P_ h, _ ff,
_ orb, and _* in spirals. We find corresponding
correlations between these quantities and _ SFR / _
HI, a proxy for the efficiency of cloud formation in dwarfs and the
outer parts of spirals. At our resolution, R_ mol appears to be a
continuous function of environment from the --dominated (R_ mol
0.1) to --dominated (R_ mol 10) regime (
).

The variation in R_ mol is too strong to be reproduced only by
varying _ orb or _ ff ( and
). Physics other than these timescales must also play an
important role in cloud formation (points 8 -- 11).

Thresholds for large scale stability do not offer an obvious way to
predict R_ mol. We find no clear relationship (continuous or
step--function) between SFE and Q_ gas, Q_ stars+gas, or the
shear threshold. The threshold values we find suggest disks that are stable
or marginally stable throughout once the effects of stars are included (
and ).

We derive a power law relationship between R_ mol and hydrostatic
pressure that is roughly consistent with expectations by
[][]ELMEGREEN93, observations by WONG02 and BLITZ06,
and simulations by ROBERTSON08. In its simplest form, this is a
variation on the classical Schmidt law, i.e., R_ mol set by gas
volume density ( and ).

Power law fits of R_ mol to P_ h ( _ ff),
radius, _ orb, and _* reproduce observed SFE reasonably
in spiral galaxies but yield large scatter or higher--than--expected SFE in
the outer parts of dwarf galaxies, offering indirect evidence that the
differences between our two subsamples --- metallicity (dust), radiation
field, and strong spiral shocks --- play a role in setting these relations
( and ).

Our data do not identify a unique driver for the SFE, but suggest that
ISM physics below our resolution --- balance between warm and cold \
phases, \ formation, and perhaps shocks and turbulent fluctuations
driven by stellar feedback --- govern the ability of the ISM to form GMCs
out of marginally stable galaxy disks ( ).
