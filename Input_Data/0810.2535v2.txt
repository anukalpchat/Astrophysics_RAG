abstract
Accretion disks with masses 10^-3-0.1M_ are believed to form during the merger of a neutron star (NS) with another NS and the merger of a NS with a black hole (BH). Soon after their formation, such hyper-accreting disks cool efficiently by neutrino emission and their composition is driven neutron-rich by pair captures under degenerate conditions. However, as the disk viscously spreads and its temperature drops, neutrino cooling is no longer able to offset viscous heating and the disk becomes advective. Analytic arguments and numerical simulations suggest that once this occurs, powerful winds likely drive away most of the disk's remaining mass. We calculate the thermal evolution and nuclear composition of viscously spreading accretion disks formed from compact object mergers using one-dimensional height-integrated simulations. We show that freeze-out from weak equilibrium necessarily accompanies the disk's late-time transition to an advective state. As a result, hyper-accreting disks generically freeze out neutron-rich (with electron fraction Y_e 0.2-0.4), and their late-time outflows robustly synthesize rare neutron-rich isotopes. Using the measured abundances of these isotopes in our solar system, we constrain the compact object merger rate in the Milky Way to be 10^-5(M_d,0/0.1M_ )^-1 yr^-1, where M_d,0 is the average initial mass of the accretion disk. Thus, either the NS-NS merger rate is at the low end of current estimates or the average disk mass produced during a typical merger is 0.1 M_ . Based on the results of current general relativistic merger simulations, the latter constraint suggests that prompt collapse to a BH is a more common outcome of NS-NS mergers than the formation of a transient hyper-massive NS. We also show that if most short duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by compact object mergers, their beaming fraction must exceed f_b 0.13(M_d,0/0.1 M_ ), corresponding to a jet half-opening angle 30^ (M_d,0/0.1M_ )^1/2. This is consistent with other evidence that short duration GRB outflows are less collimated than those produced in long duration GRBs.

Massive, compact accretion disks are thought to form in a number of astrophysical events, including the merger of a black hole and a neutron star (BH-NS; Lattimer \& Schramm 1974, 1976), the merger of a double NS binary (NS-NS; Eichler et al.~1989), the collapse of a rapidly-rotating stellar core (Woosley 1993), the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) to a NS (Dessart et al.~2006, 2007), and the AIC of a NS to a BH (Vietri \& Stella 1998, 1999). These disks are termed ``hyper-accreting'' due to their large accretion rates of up to several solar masses per second. Rapid accretion onto a BH following the collapse of a massive star is a popular model for the central engine of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) (MacFadyen \& Woosley 1999) due to their association with star forming regions and Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) (Woosley \& Bloom 2006). Short-duration GRBs, on the other hand, originate from a more evolved progenitor population (e.g., Berger et al.~2005) and may instead result from compact object (CO) mergers (e.g., Lee \& Ramirez-Ruiz 2007), or the AIC of a WD (Metzger et al.~2008a) or a NS (MacFadyen et al.~2005).

Hyper-accreting disks cool via neutrino emission when the accretion rate is sufficiently high ( M 0.01-0.1 M_ s^-1; Popham et al.~1999). This allows the disk midplane to become dense and electron degenerate (Chen \& Beloborodov 2007). Because positron captures (e^++n p+ _e) are suppressed relative to electron captures (e^-+p n+ _e) under degenerate conditions, neutrino-cooled disks are driven neutron-rich (Pruet et al.~2003; Beloborodov 2003), i.e., to an electron fraction Y_e n_ p/(n_ p + n_ n) < 0.5, where n_ p and n_ n are the proton and neutron density, respectively.

If a portion of this neutron-rich material escapes the disk, several observable consequences may result (e.g., Derishev et al.~1999). In particular, although highly relativistic outflows are required to produce GRBs, slower outflows from larger radii in the disk are probably at least as common (e.g., Pruet et al.~2004). These dense outflows may synthesize heavy, neutron-rich isotopes as they expand away from the midplane and cool. Such outflows are difficult to detect directly because neutron-rich isotopes have short half-lives ( seconds; Freiburghaus et al.~1999) and are thus unlikely to power a bright SN-like transient via their radioactive decay (although a dimmer, shorter-lived transient may be produced; Li \& Paczynski 1998; Kulkarni 2005; Metzger, Piro, \& Quataert 2008, hereafter MPQ08).

Neutron-rich outflows can also be probed indirectly via their effect on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. For instance, moderately neutron-rich outflows with Y_e 0.35-0.4 produce isotopes (e.g., ^79Br and ^78Se) that are rare in our solar system (Hartmann et al.~1985; Woosley \& Hoffman 1992). Hence, the measured abundances of these isotopes place stringent constraints on the rate at which low-Y_e material is ejected into the interstellar medium (ISM). In turn, if the amount of neutron-rich material ejected in a given event can be estimated, the true rate and beaming fraction (or jet opening angle) could in principle be constrained in models that associate these events with GRBs (e.g., Woosley \& Baron 1992; Fryer et al.~1999). Constraints on the rate of CO mergers are particularly interesting because they are the primary target for km-scale gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, and rates derived from known merging systems (Kalogera et al.~2004; Kim et al.~2006) and population synthesis models (e.g., Belczynski et al.~2006) remain highly uncertain.

Summary of Previous Work

Most previous efforts to determine the composition of outflows from hyper-accreting disks have focused on winds driven by neutrino irradiation from the inner disk (Levinson 2006; Surman et al.~2006, 2008; Barzilay \& Levinson 2007; Metzger et al.~2008b), in analogy to those from proto-neutron stars following successful core-collapse SNe (e.g., Burrows, Hayes, \& Fryxell 1995). However, the electron fraction at the base of neutrino-driven outflows is typically not preserved as matter accelerates to large radii because neutrino absorptions (p+ _e n+e^+ and n+ _e p+e^-) drive Y_e to the equilibrium value
Y_e^ [1 + (L_ _e _ _e /L_ _e _ _e )]^-1

given by the properties of the neutrino radiation field, where L_ _e/L_ _e and _ _e / _ _e are the mean _e/ _e luminosities and energies, respectively, from the central NS or accretion disk (Qian et al.~1993). When the accretion rate is very high ( M M_ s^-1) and the inner disk is optically thick to neutrinos, Y_e^ can itself be 0.5 because the _e's originate from regions of higher temperature than the _e's (e.g., Surman et al.~2006). However, a disk with a fixed initial mass (such as is produced by a CO merger) spends very little time (if any) accreting at such a high rate; most neutrino-driven mass loss from a viscously-spreading disk occurs at later times, when the entire disk is optically thin and Y_e^ 0.5 (see Fig.~9 of MPQ08). Thus, while early-time neutrino-driven outflows may produce modest amounts of r-process ejecta, their total yield in the context of CO mergers is probably insufficient to contribute appreciably to the Galactic abundance of neutron-rich isotopes (e.g., Surman et al.~2008). However, as we now discuss, later stages in the disk's evolution, when neutrino irradiation is relatively unimportant, are likely to eject even larger quantities of neutron-rich material.

In a recent paper (MPQ08), we used a one-zone (or ``ring'') model to study the evolution of hyper-accreting disks. Guided by analytic work (Blandford \& Begelman 1999) and numerical simulations (e.g., Stone \& Pringle 2001; Hawley, Balbus, \& Stone 2001; Hawley \& Balbus 2002) which show that radiatively-inefficient accretion drives powerful outflows, we argued that the majority of the disk becomes unbound soon following the disk's transition to an advective state at late times. Since ejection occurs on approximately the dynamical timescale (which is faster than weak interactions at this stage), these ``viscously-driven'' outflows maintain the electron fraction of the disk midplane, unlike the neutrino-driven outflows at earlier times. Thus, in order to determine what isotopes are ultimately synthesized, the electron fraction in the disk must be known at late times when the disk becomes advective.

Outline of this Paper

In this paper we determine the composition of late-time outflows from hyper-accreting disks by calculating the disk's midplane composition as the disk viscously spreads and falls out of weak equilibrium. We concentrate in particular on BH accretion following a CO merger Although we center our discussion on accretion following CO mergers, most of our conclusions would apply equally to the AIC of a NS to a BH, which may produce a disk with similar initial properties (Shibata 2003; Shapiro 2004). (either NS-NS or NS-BH models), where a fixed initial disk mass is a reasonable approximation. In we use a one-zone model similar to that in MPQ08 to calculate Y_e(t) for a wide variety of plausible initial disk masses and sizes. Although the one-zone model in captures the basic evolution of hyper-accreting disks, the subsequent nucleosynthesis depends sensitively on the freeze-out electron fraction Y_e^f, and so a more detailed calculation is warranted. Furthermore, a one-zone model cannot, by construction, address the possibility that different annuli in the disk may freeze out with different values of Y_e^f. Therefore in we present one-dimensional (1D), height-integrated calculations of the evolution of CO merger disks and their composition, and use them to determine the electron fraction mass distribution M(Y_e^f) at late times. We find that under most conditions the majority of the mass freezes out neutron-rich with Y_e^f 0.2-0.4. In we summarize our results and use them to constrain the CO merger rate and the beaming fraction of short GRBs.

One Zone Model

In this section we present calculations of the electron fraction at freeze-out Y_e^f using a one-zone ``ring'' model similar to that presented in MPQ08. The simplicity of this model allows us to efficiently explore a wide parameter space of initial disk mass M_d,0 and radius r_d,0, and it also provides a useful point of comparison for our 1D calculations in . The initial conditions and relevant equations are presented in . In we present our results and show, using a simple analytic argument, that a moderately neutron-rich freeze-out (i.e., Y_e^f 0.5) is generically expected, relatively independent of the details of how the disk viscously spreads.

Equations and Initial Conditions

Since the accretion disks produced during CO mergers are created from tidally disrupted NS material, we take the initial electron fraction to be Y_e^0 = 0.1, which is characteristic of the inner neutron star crust (e.g., Haensel \& Zdunik 1990a,b; Pethick \& Ravenhall 1995). In most of our calculations we take the BH mass to be M_ BH = 3 M_ . The mass and radial profile of the remnant disks formed from CO mergers are uncertain theoretically because they depend on the unknown supranuclear-density equation of state and general relativistic effects, which are now being explored in merger simulations (e.g., Shibata \& Taniguchi 2006). Disk masses M_d 10^-3-0.3 M_ with characteristic sizes 10^6-3 10^7 cm appear typical (e.g., Rasio et al.~2005; Oechslin \& Janka 2006; Shibata \& Taniguchi 2006).

The equations and assumptions employed in our one-zone model closely follow those in MPQ08. To provide a brief summary, our calculation follows the thermal and viscous evolution of the disk radius r_d(t) (the ``ring'') that contains the majority of the mass, controls the accretion rate M onto the central object, and moves outwards as the disk accretes in order to conserve the total angular momentum J M_dr_d^1/2. Our energy equation includes viscous heating and the dominant neutrino opacities. The model is calibrated so as to reproduce the exact -function solution to the viscous diffusion equation (eq.~[]) at late times. Although we refer the reader to MPQ08 for details, we include here a brief discussion of changes and additions we have made and highlight the equations most important for this work.

The electron fraction is evolved using

dY_edt = ( _e^+n+ _ _en) [1-Y_e- ( 1-X_ f2 ) ]


-( _e^-p+ _ _ep) [Y_e- ( 1-X_ f2 ) ],


where d/dt is a Lagrangian derivative, _e^-p/ _e^+n are the pair capture rates (see Beloborodov 2003, eqs.~[6], [7]), X_ f is the free nucleon mass fraction in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) (from, e.g., Woosley \& Baron 1992), and

_ N = L_ _ NX_N4 r_d^2 _ (1+ _ N) 500 X_NL_52 _10 r_6^2(1+ _ N) \, s^-1


are the neutrino capture rates (e.g., Qian \& Woosley 1996) due to irradiation from the inner accretion disk (see the discussion below). In equation (), N stands for either _en or _ep, X_N is the corresponding proton or neutron mass fraction, L_ L_5210^52 ergs s^-1 is the neutrino luminosity, _ 10 _10 MeV is the mean neutrino energy, and _ N 9 10^-44 _ ^2 MeV^-2cm^2 is the neutrino capture cross section. The factor (1 + _ N) accounts for the possibility that the absorbing annulus may become optically thick, where _ N _ NX_N r_d/2m_p is the neutrino optical depth and is the density; our calculation is fairly insensitive to this prescription for when _ > 1, however, because _ is generally 1 at freeze-out. We neglect the proton-neutron mass difference 1.3 MeV and the effects of electron degeneracy in calculating _ N because the energies of the neutrinos that dominate the heating ( _ 10 MeV) greatly exceed and the electron Fermi energy, respectively. We assume relativistic e^-/e^+ pairs when calculating the electron chemical potential; we have verified that this is a good approximation by checking that including the effects of arbitrary e^-/e^+ energies has no significant effect on the value of Y_e^f. NSE is a generally a good assumption in calculating X_f because the entropy in the disk is sufficiently low that -particles form while the midplane temperature is still high (T 0.5 MeV).

The dominant process that sets Y_e during the thin disk phase is pair capture on free nuclei (e.g., Pruet et al.~2003). However, neutrino absorptions become important near freeze-out and must be included in a detailed calculation (see Fig.~). The neutrino absorption rate _ N is dominated by the high energy neutrinos that are radiated from the smallest radii in the disk. We calculate L_ and _ by extending our solutions down to the innermost stable orbit r_*, assuming that M is constant with radius interior to r_d. The neutrino flux is reasonably approximated as a ``light bulb'' at the origin in equation () because the neutrino capture rates only become comparable to the pair capture rates when the disk has spread to a radius that is much larger than that of the central BH.

Since neutrino captures only affect Y_e appreciably at times when the inner disk is optically thin to neutrinos, we assume that L_ _e L_ _e and _ _e _ _e (see the discussion in 5.3 of MPQ08 for why this is a good approximation). Thus, the effect of neutrino captures is to drive Y_e towards Y_e^ 0.5 (see eq.~[]). The effect of -particle formation (i.e., X_f 0 in eq.~[]) would also be to drive Y_e 0.5 (the ``alpha-effect''; e.g., Fuller \& Meyer 1995); however, this effect is unimportant in our calculations because weak freeze-out generally precedes -particle formation.

One difference relative to MPQ08 is that here we take the viscous stress to be proportional to just the ion gas pressure P_ gas, as opposed to the total pressure P_ tot, which also includes radiation pressure from photons and e^-/e^+ pairs. In other words, we take the kinematic viscosity to be

= P_ gas/ ,


where is a dimensionless constant and is the Keplerian rotation rate. At early times in the evolution of the disk (in particular when it is neutrino-cooled), the disk is primarily supported by gas pressure and so using either P_ tot or P_ gas gives similar results. However, as the disk becomes thick at late times and Y_e freezes out, the disk becomes dominated by radiation pressure, with P_ tot/P_ gas 2-3 during freeze-out (see Fig.~). The primary reason that we use P_ gas instead of P_ tot in equation () is to avoid the classic Lightman-Eardley (1974) viscous instability, which we otherwise find develops in our full 1D calculations described in . Because P_ tot/P_ gas is modest ( 3) during the times that matter to our results, we choose 0.3 and 0.03 as fiducial values for our calculations, to roughly bracket the value of 0.1 motivated by a number of astrophysical observations (King et al.~2007). For typical disk parameters, we find that taking P_ gas instead of P_ tot in our one-zone models results in a modest ( 20\

As an improvement over MPQ08, our calculation of the cooling rates due to e^-/e^+ captures on free nuclei now includes the effects of arbitrary electron energy and degeneracy. In addition, we include heating from the absorption of neutrinos that are radiated from the accretion disk at small radii (see eq.~[]). Finally, as in MPQ08 we apply a ``no torque'' boundary condition at the inner radius r_*= 10^6 cm, which corresponds to the radius of the innermost stable orbit around a rapidly rotating Kerr BH (a = 0.9).

The process of weak freeze-out in our one-zone model of a viscously-spreading, hyper-accreting disk. The left panel shows the time evolution of the electron fraction Y_e ( solid line), disk thickness H/r_d ( dashed line), degeneracy parameter _e/kT ( triple-dot-dashed line), and the ratio of gas to total pressure P_ gas/P_ tot ( dot-dashed line), calculated for = 0.3 and for a disk with initial mass M_d,0 = 0.1M_ and radius r_d,0 = 3 10^6 cm. Also shown with a dotted line is the equilibrium electron fraction Y_e^eq obtained by setting the right hand side of equation () to zero. The right panel shows the rates of the weak interactions that modify Y_e(t), normalized to the viscous timescale t_ visc. The electron, positron, and neutrino capture rates are denoted by _ep, _e^+n, and _ N, respectively. Note that Y_e freezes out of equilibrium at the same time that the disk becomes advective (H/r_d 0.5) and non-degenerate ( _e kT). Since Y_e^eq rises to 0.5 as the disk becomes non-degenerate, the final composition is only moderately neutron-rich, with a final electron fraction Y_e^f 0.43.

figure*
Figure shows contour plots of the freeze-out electron fraction Y_e^f as a function of the initial disk mass M_d,0 and radius r_d,0 using two different values of the viscosity, = 0.03 and 0.3.

The basic features of Figure can be understood as follows. Sufficiently massive, compact disks (upper left corner of Fig.~) come into pair capture-equilibrium and obtain an electron fraction that is relatively independent of the initial value Y_e^0 = 0.1, while low mass, more extended disks (lower right corner) retain their initial composition. As discussed below, a disk enters -equilibrium if and only if it can cool efficiently via neutrino emission (see eq.~[]). By equating the radius where neutrino cooling balances 1/2 of the viscous heating in a self-similar solution for a thick disk, we estimate analytically that disks that satisfy

M_d,0 3 10^-3 ( r_d,010^7 cm )^7/3 ( 0.1 )^2/3M_


are sufficiently compact to become neutrino-cooled and neutron-rich at early stages in their evolution (see also MPQ08 eqs.~[19]-[21]). Equation () does a reasonable job of reproducing the parameter space in Figure where Y_e^f differs significantly from its initial value. For instance, equation () shows that lower values of allow less massive disks of a fixed size to enter -equilibrium; this is consistent with the wider parameter space with Y_e^f>Y_e^0=0.1 at low .

To illustrate the process of weak freeze-out explicitly, Figure ( left panel) shows the evolution of the electron fraction Y_e(t) for a disk with M_d,0 = 0.1 M_ and r_d,0 = 3 10^6 cm. We also show the equilibrium electron fraction Y_e^eq (obtained by setting the right hand side of eq.~[] to zero), the ratio of the disk scaleheight to the radius H/r_d, the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure P_ gas/P_ tot, and the ratio of the electron chemical potential to the disk temperature _e/kT (i.e., the degeneracy parameter). Also shown for comparison in the right panel of Figure are the weak interaction rates from equation (), normalized to the viscous timescale t_ visc ^-1 ^-1(H/r_d)^-2.

Figure shows that at early times, when the disk is neutrino-cooled and H/r_d 1/3, pair captures are rapid compared to the viscous timescale. Thus, the disk enters -equilibrium with an electron fraction Y_e Y_e^eq that is 0.5 because positron captures are suppressed relative to electron captures under the degenerate conditions ( _e kT) in the midplane. At later times (t 0.1 s) the disk thickens to H/r_d 0.5 and becomes non-degenerate ( _e kT) and radiation pressure-dominated. At this point Y_e^ eq rises to 0.5 because positron captures under non-degenerate conditions now become energetically favored over electron captures due to the proton-neutron mass difference. Note, however, that as the disk thickens weak interactions become slow compared to the viscous timescale and Y_e freezes out at the value Y_e^f 0.43. Although (non-local) neutrino absorptions are unimportant relative to electron captures at early times, their rate _ N is comparable to the pair capture rates near freeze-out and must be included to accurately determine Y_e^f.

Figure shows that moderately neutron-rich freeze-out (Y_e^f 0.3-0.5) is a common feature of accretion disks formed from CO mergers for a wide range of initial conditions. However, contrasting the disk's neutron-rich equilibrium state (Y_e Y_e^eq 0.1) at early times with its final, non-degenerate state that actually favors a proton-rich composition in equilibrium (i.e., Y_e^eq > 0.5), it is a priori unclear why Y_e freezes out with a value Y_e^f 0.3-0.5 between these two extremes.

To understand why this is the case, note that an approximate condition for weak freeze-out is that the pair capture timescale becomes longer than the viscous time t_ visc. Since the disk becomes non-degenerate around freeze-out, electron and positron captures occur at a similar rate (e.g., Qian \& Woosley 1996)

	 _eN 0.45T_ MeV^5 \,s^-1,


where T T_ MeVMeV and eN represents either e^-p or e^+n. The associated URCA cooling rate per nucleon is given by
	
	 Q_eN = _ _eN 2.3T_ MeV^6 \,MeV\,s^-1,


where _ 5.04kT is the mean neutrino energy released per capture. The viscous heating rate per nucleon at r r_* is

	 Q_ visc = 94 ^2m_ N 94 m_ Nr^2 ^3 ( Hr )^2,


where m_ N is the nucleon mass. If we assume that the disk is supported primarily by gas pressure As discussed in and shown in Figure , gas and radiation pressure are comparable at freeze-out; the assumption that gas pressure dominates is, however, sufficient for the purposes of a simple estimate. then the midplane temperature is kT m_ Nr^2 ^2(H/r)^2. Combining this with equations ()-() we find that

_eNt_ visc =


94 ( kT _ ) ( Hr )^-2 ( Q_eN Q_ visc ) 1.8 ( Q_eN Q_ visc ) ( H/r0.5 )^-2.


Equation () shows that once neutrino cooling no longer offsets viscous heating (i.e., Q_ visc Q_eN) and the disk thickens to H/r 1, weak freeze-out (i.e., _eNt_ visc 1) necessarily results. Physically, this occurs because the disk is cooled by e^-/e^+ captures, the very same processes that largely control the evolution of Y_e (see Fig.~). This conclusion is fairly robust because it applies at any radius and is independent of the value of . Although the absorption of neutrinos from the central disk threatens to complicate this simple argument, the right panel of Figure shows that the effect of absorptions is at most comparable to that of pair captures prior to freeze-out.

Height-Integrated Model

The results of suggest that neutron-rich freeze-out is a common feature of viscously-spreading, hyper-accreting disks. However, the one-zone model makes a number of simplifying assumption that may affect the final electron fraction Y_e^f. In this section we present a 1D (height-integrated) model of a viscously-spreading disk that more precisely determines Y_e^f and its distribution with mass. In we describe the initial conditions and relevant equations. Then we present our results in .

Equations and Initial Conditions

Our 1D calculation evolves the surface density , midplane temperature T, and electron fraction Y_e as a function of radius r and time t using the 2N-RK3 (6th order space, 3rd order time) scheme described in Brandenburg (2001). We use a logarithmic radial grid that extends from just outside the inner edge of the disk at r_* = 10^6 cm, out to a radius that safely exceeds the outer edge of the disk at the final time step (typically 10^9 cm).

The surface density is evolved according to the diffusion equation for an axisymmetric disk in a Newtonian 1/r gravitational potential (e.g., Frank et al.~2002):
t = 3r
r [r^1/2 r ( r^1/2 ) ],


where the viscosity is proportional to just the gas pressure (see eq.~[] and surrounding discussion). The radial velocity v_r is not evolved explicitly but instead follows from equation () and mass continuity:
v_r = -3 r^1/2 r ( r^1/2 ).


We take the initial surface density of the disk to be
(r,t=0) ( rr_d,0 )^m [-(2+m) ( rr_d,0 ) ],


with the constant of proportionality set by requiring that the total disk mass equals M_d,0. Equation () concentrates the initial disk mass r^2 about the radius r_d,0, with larger values of the parameter m resulting in a more narrowly concentrated mass distribution. As discussed in , the precise mass distribution of disks produced from CO mergers is uncertain theoretically. In most of our calculations we take m = 5, although our results are relatively insensitive to m. Due to numerical issues that arise from the exponential drop-off of at the outer edge of the disk, we impose an initial density floor that is sufficiently small that matter at the density floor contains a fraction 10^-3 of the total disk mass at any time; we have verified that our results are insensitive to the level of this floor as long as it contains negligible mass. We have also performed calculations using a power-law density distribution that concentrates the disk's initial mass at small radii (e.g., r^-3); we find results that are similar to those obtained using equation () with r_d,0 taken near the disk's inner edge.

We calculate the scaleheight H by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, i.e., we take H = c_s/ , where c_s (P_ tot/ )^1/2 is the isothermal sound speed. We evolve the midplane temperature using the equation for the specific entropy S, which is given by

T dSdt = q_ visc - q_ ^- + q_ ^+,


where (d/dt) ( / t) + v_r( / r), q_ visc = (9/4) ^2 is the viscous heating rate, and q_ ^- is the neutrino cooling rate, as given in Di Matteo et al.~(2002) but modified to include the effects of arbitrary Y_e and electron degeneracy (e.g., Beloborodov 2003). The term
q_ ^+ = _ _ep _ _e [Y_e- ( 1-X_ f2 ) ]+


_ _en _ _e [1-Y_e- ( 1-X_ f2 ) ]

represents neutrino heating from the inner radii of the accretion disk, where _ _en and _ _ep are the neutrino capture rates given by equation (). We not not include heating due to -particle formation because we are primarily interested in determining the final electron fraction, and -particles form only after the disk has fallen out of weak equilibrium.

The initial temperature profile is set by requiring that H/r = 0.3 at all radii. An initially thick disk is physically motivated by the fact that CO merger disks form dynamically hot; however, because the thermal time is short compared to the viscous time, the disk's evolution quickly becomes independent of the initial scaleheight anyways.

Finally, we evolve the electron fraction profile Y_e(r) using equation (), with d/dt = / t + v_r / r. To keep the required timesteps reasonable, we equate Y_e with its equilibrium value Y_e^eq when the weak interaction rates greatly exceed the local viscous rate 1/t_ visc. As in , we take the initial electron fraction to be Y_e^0 = 0.1 at all radii.

The surface density across the ghost zones at the inner boundary is set to enforce a constant mass accretion rate M at the value of M in the first active zone. We interpolate the temperature and electron fraction at the inner boundary. Unlike in the one-zone calculations in , we do not implement a no-torque boundary condition on the inner edge of the disk, in part because it leads to an unphysical temperature profile at small radii (in particular, T 0 as r r_*). Our results for Y_e^f are not sensitive to this boundary condition. We also interpolate all variables at the outer boundary, although this choice has no effect on our results because the outer boundary is not in causal contact with the inner flow. We have verified that our code conserves total mass M_ tot and angular momentum J by checking that decreases in M_ tot and J with time are compensated by their fluxes across the inner grid cell.

Figure shows the local disk mass r^2 ( top) and the absolute value of the mass advection rate M 2 r v_r ( bottom) as a function of radius r at times t = 0.01,0.1, and 1 s, with later times denoted by increasingly thinner lines; these epochs correspond to 1, 10, and 100 times the initial viscous time at r=r_d,0.

Figure shows that the disk spreads outwards in time, reaching 3 10^8 cm by t 1 s. After a few viscous times, a constant inward accretion rate is established at small radii that roughly matches the outward mass advection rate of the bulk of the disk. The inner steady-state disk almost extends to the stagnation point where v_r = 0, which moves outwards with time.

Figure shows radial profiles of the disk thickness H/r ( top), the ratio of neutrino cooling q_ cool = q_ ^- to total heating q_ heat q_ visc + q^+_ ( middle), and the midplane temperature ( bottom). Figure illustrates that at early times the bulk of the disk becomes efficiently cooled by neutrinos (i.e., q_ cool q_ heat) and geometrically thin (H/r 1). At later times, as the disk spreads and the temperature decreases, neutrinos are no long able to cool the majority of the mass efficiently (i.e., q_ cool q_ heat) and H/r increases. As discussed in MPQ08, the outer disk becomes thick first, and radiatively inefficient conditions move inwards as M decreases. This behavior can be seen explicitly in Figure by comparing where H/r becomes large at early and late times. Note that the small ``bump'' in H/r corresponds to low-density material on the very outer edge of the disk which separates the density floor (where the thermal time is always much longer than the evolution timescale) from the bulk of the disk. This artifact of our initial conditions has no effect on our conclusions. Also note that at late times (t = 1 s) a range of radii around r 40 km has q_ cool > q_ heat. This region of net cooling radiates the thermal energy carried into the neutrino-cooled portion of the disk from the higher entropy advective disk at larger radii.

Figure shows the evolution of the electron fraction Y_e ( solid\,line) and its equilibrium value Y_e^eq ( dotted\,line). At very early times the entire disk is in weak equilibrium, with Y_e = Y_e^eq at all radii that contain substantial mass. At radii larger than the extent of the disk, Y_e remains equal to its initial value at all times because these regions (which comprise the density floor) never enter equilibrium. However, as the disk spreads and thickens, the midplane becomes non-degenerate, which causes Y_e^eq to rise. As this occurs, weak interactions become slow compared to the timescale over which the disk evolves (for the same reasons discussed in ), and Y_e begins to freeze out of equilibrium as it lags behind the rising value of Y_e^eq. As with radiatively inefficient conditions, freeze-out begins at the outer edge of the disk and moves inwards with time. By the final time step the majority of the disk mass has frozen out, with values of Y_e^f that span the range Y_e^f 0.1-0.5. This behavior is directly analagous to the freeze-out of the ``ring'' radius in the one-zone model (Fig.~), but now occuring in each annulus of the disk.

In Figure we quantify the global process by which the disk becomes advective and falls out of weak equilibrium by showing the time evolution of the total disk mass M_ tot, the total mass that is advective M_ tot^ adv, and the total mass that has fallen out of weak equilibrium M_ tot^ f. We define annuli that are advective and have fallen out of equilibrium as those that satisfy
q_ cool q_ heat/2


and
_ max 3/t_ visc,


respectively, where _ max is the maximum of the weak interaction rates in equation (). Although the numerical prefactors used in equations () and () are somewhat arbitrary, our results are not sensitive to their precise values. Figure shows that M_ tot decreases with time as matter accretes onto the BH, with M_ tot t^-1/3 at late times, as expected from the self-similar behavior of an advective disk with H/r constant (MPQ08).
After an initial viscous time, a comparable amount of material is advective and out of equilibrium; M_ tot^ adv and M_ tot^f remain fairly constant at 2 10^-2M_ until the majority of the disk becomes advective and freezes out at late times.

As discussed in , once a portion of the disk becomes advective, a viscously-driven outflow likely drives away a substantial portion of its mass (e.g., Blandford \& Begelman 1999). In our calculations we have neglected the effects of such a mass sink on the evolution of the disk. Figure shows that this approximation remains reasonable until t 0.03-0.1 s because prior to this point the majority of the disk remains neutrino cooled. Mass and angular momentum loss to a wind leads to a more rapid decline in M, which further speeds up the onset of the advective phase and weak freeze-out at smaller radii (MPQ08).

In Figure we show histograms of mass as a function of electron fraction M(Y_e) at the times t = 0.03 s and t = 0.3 s. The solid and dashed lines are the matter that is advective and out of -equilibrium, respectively (as defined by eqs.~[] and []). These distributions typically correspond to the same matter because annuli fall out of equilibrium as they become advective (see eq.~[]). We show the composition at these two particular times because they correspond to epochs when the disk has become 50\

It is useful to compare the results in Figure with the one zone calculation from for the same initial disk parameters (see Fig.~). When the disk is 90\

In Figures and we show histograms similar to Figure , but for solutions calculated with a lower viscosity ( = 0.03) and a lower initial mass (M_d,0 = 0.01M_ ), respectively. The times chosen correspond to epochs when the disk is 50\

We have performed freeze-out calculations for a number of other disk parameters. In Table we summarize our results for Y_e^f and the fraction f_ adv of the initial disk mass that remains when the disk is 90\

Discussion

Accretion disks formed from CO mergers that are sufficiently massive and compact to satisfy equation () become neutrino-cooled, degenerate, and neutron-rich early in their evolution. Eventually, as the disk accretes and viscously spreads, neutrino cooling is no longer able to offset viscous heating and the disk becomes advective. At this point several important changes occur nearly simultaneously: the disk becomes geometrically thick (H/r 1), radiation pressure-dominated, and non-degenerate at the same time that the equilibrium electron fraction Y_e^eq rises from 0.5 to 0.5 and Y_e freezes out (Fig.~; see also Beloborodov 2008). Weak freeze-out necessarily accompanies the disk's advective transition because e^-/e^+ captures are primarily responsible for both cooling the disk and setting its electron fraction (see eq.~[] of ). Because Y_e^eq is rising as freeze-out occurs, moderately neutron-rich freeze-out with Y_e^f 0.2-0.4 is a generic feature of accretion disks formed from CO mergers. Our calculations in and largely confirm this basic conclusion (see Table ).

Neutron-rich freeze-out in hyper-accreting disks is usefully contrasted with the proton- rich freeze-out (Y_e^f 0.88) in the very early universe. Big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) occurred on a timescale of minutes under non-degenerate and highly radiation-dominated conditions (entropy S 10^10 k_B baryon^-1). By contrast, hyper-accreting disks freeze out on a timescale 0.1-1 s (depending on ) under moderately degenerate conditions, and with comparable gas and radiation pressure, i.e., S 3-20 k_B baryon^-1. Hyper-accreting disks freeze-out neutron-rich because they start in -equilibrium under degenerate conditions, while the early universe never had Y_e < 0.5 because degeneracy effects were never important.

A further important difference is in the production of heavy elements. Once the disk becomes advective and freezes out, a viscously-driven wind likely unbinds most of its remaining mass; as these outflows expand away from the midplane and cool, heavy elements will be formed. Due to the ``deuterium bottleneck,'' BBN produced almost no elements heavier than He. By contrast, the late-time outflows from hyper-accreting disks possess modest entropies The entropy in the outflow is probably only a few k_B baryon^-1 larger than in the disk midplane because only a fraction of the gravitational binding energy is required to drive an outflow (advective disks are only marginally bound). and are thus generally in NSE when -particles form. Even an -rich freeze-out is unlikely (Hoffman \& Woosley 1992) because, under dense (low entropy) neutron-rich conditions, 's burn efficiently via the reaction sequence ^4He( n, )^9Be( ,n)^12C (Delano \& Cameron 1971). As discussed further in , the abundances of the elements synthesized are thus approximately determined by neutron-rich NSE (Hartmann et al.~1985).

It is also important to contrast the site of nucleosynthesis that we have introduced here with outflows driven from the disk by neutrino heating (e.g., Levinson 2006; Barzilay \& Levison 2008; Metzger et al.~2008b). Neutrino-driven outflows generally occur at early times or small radii, when the disk midplane is still in -equilibrium and the irradiating neutrino flux is substantial. The outflow's final electron fraction in this case is set by an equilibrium with neutrino absorptions (Y_e Y_e^ in eq.~[]) and is not directly related to Y_e in the midplane (e.g., Surman \& McLaughlin 2004). By contrast, the outflows considered here occur after the midplane itself has fallen out of weak equilibrium, and so the disk's electron fraction Y_e^f is retained by the outflow. While neutrino absorptions in the disk are somewhat important near freeze-out, at no point does the midplane electron fraction enter equilibrium with the neutrinos, as generically occurs in neutrino-driven outflows (Metzger et al.~2008b). Instead, the outwardly-spreading disk provides a protective ``cocoon'' that transports low-Y_e material (kept neutron-rich by degenerate electron capture) away from the deneutronizing flux of neutrinos from the central disk. Furthermore, the viscously-driven outflows that we have focused on carry away a substantial fraction of the disk's initial mass; because neutrino-driven outflows likely eject less mass (MPQ08), the total nucleosynthetic yield from CO mergers is probably dominated by the viscously-driven outflows at late times.

Finally, although we believe that the disk is largely unbound by viscous heating once it becomes advective (Blandford \& Begelman 1999; Stone \& Pringle 2001), if nothing else the energy released by -particle (or even heavier element) formation is sufficient to unbind the disk at late times (Lee \& Ramirez-Ruiz 2007; MPQ08). Since -particle formation occurs soon after the disk becomes advective, our conclusions would be qualitatively unchanged if nuclear (rather than viscous) energy powers the late-time outflow. In this case the formation of heavy elements would begin in the disk midplane, but the final nucleosynthetic yield would probably be similar.

Implications

As we have argued, moderate entropy, neutron-rich outflows appear to be a common property of accretion disks formed from CO mergers at late times. Although detailed calculations of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in these outflows need to be performed, the late-time conditions in the disk favor the production of elements with abundances close to their NSE values at charged-particle reaction freeze-out. In particular, the entropies ( 10 k_B baryon^-1) and dynamical timescales ( _ dyn 0.01-0.1 s) at freeze-out are similar to those explored in low entropy nucleosynthesis calculations by Woosley \& Hoffman (1992). For example, in their model with S 29 k_B baryon^-1 and _ dyn 0.1 s, these authors find that all -particles reassemble into heavy nuclei for Y_e 0.45, and that the final abundances closely resemble those of NSE (see the second column in their Table 2).

Neutron-rich NSE calculations were performed by Hartmann et al.~(1985). For Y_e 0.35-0.40, they find that the predominant isotopes created are ^82Se, ^79Br, and ^78Se (in order of decreasing Y_e; see their Fig.~3). The very low solar system abundances of these isotopes (total mass fraction X_ 3 10^-8) strongly constrains the rate of astrophysical events that produce material with Y_e 0.35-0.4 in NSE: we estimate that the maximum allowed mass ejection of material with Y_e 0.35-0.4 into the ISM is M_ max (M_ galX_ /t_ gal) 1.5 10^-7M_ yr^-1, where t_ gal 10^10 yrs and M_ gal 5 10^10M_ and are the age and baryonic mass of the Galaxy, respectively (Binney \& Tremaine 1994). More neutron-rich material (Y_e 0.35) will produce even heavier isotopes and, possibly, an r-process. Since these elements are also very rare, a similar constraint can be placed on the rate that very low-Y_e material is ejected into the ISM. For instance, isotopes near the second r-process peak (A 130) have a typical solar mass abundance X_ ^r 10^-9 relative to hydrogen; therefore, if material ejected with 0.2 Y_e 0.35 produced equal numbers of N 10 r-process isotopes in this mass range, the constraint on the mass ejected would be M_ max 5 10^-8(N/10)M_ yr^-1, comparable to the rate for material with Y_e 0.35-0.4 given above. In order to be conservative, below we use the constraint M_ max 1.5 10^-7M_ yr^-1 for all material ejected with Y_e 0.4. However, a more precise determination of the isotopes produced by the ejection of moderate entropy material with Y_e 0.2-0.35 would likely place even stronger constraints on the rate of CO mergers.

Based on Figures - and our one-zone calculations in we find that a fraction f_ adv 0.2-0.5 of the disk's initial mass remains when it becomes advective at late times (see Table ), with a higher fraction for less massive, more extended disks. Of this material, we estimate that the majority of the mass will have Y_e^f 0.4, when averaging over many events with different initial disk properties (see Figs.~- and Table ). Although ejecta from mergers that occur outside Galactic disk will not enrich the ISM, population synthesis studies estimate that for large spirals such as the Milky Way only a small fraction ( 20\

N_ max M_ max M_d,0 10^-5 ( 0.2 )^-1 ( M_d,0 0.1M_ )^-1 yr^-1,


where we have normalized to a typical value 0.2.

Based on observed binary NS systems, Kalogera et al.~(2004) find that the NS-NS merger rate in the Milky Way is between 1.7 10^-5 and 2.9 10^-4 yr^-1 at 95\

Ultimately, equation () must be combined with GR simulations of the merger process that determine M_d,0 as a function of the total binary mass M_ tot = M_1 + M_2, the NS mass ratio q = M_1/M_2 1, and the NS equation of state (EOS). General relativistic merger simulations (Shibata et al.~2005; Shibata \& Taniguchi 2006) find that when M_ tot is above a critical value ( 2.6M_ , depending on the EOS) the central object produced during the merger promptly collapses to a BH. In this case, M_d,0 decreases rapidly with increasing q (see Shibata \& Taniguchi 2006, Fig.~13). For instance, when the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B (with q 0.935 and M_ tot = 2.587M_ ) merges in 100 Myr, current simulations predict that the disk will have a mass 10^-3-10^-2M_ if BH formation is prompt (Shibata \& Taniguchi 2006). This disk mass is reasonably consistent with our constraint in equation () and current NS-NS merger rate estimates. It is also consistent with the relatively low isotropic energies of short GRBs with measured redshifts ( 10^-5-10^-3M_ c^2; Nakar 2007).

On the other hand, simulations find that when M_ tot is below the threshold for prompt collapse, a hypermassive NS supported by differential rotation is initially formed (Baumgarte et al.~2000). If this NS is able to transport angular momentum outwards, it will collapse to a BH on a longer timescale ( 100 ms; Shibata et al.~2006; Duez et al.~2006), producing a sizable disk ( 0.03M_ ) whose mass is relatively independent of q (Oechslin \& Janka 2006; Shibata et al.~2006). Since the disk masses formed after delayed collapse are comparable to those allowed by our constraint in equation () even for low N 10^-5 yr^-1, our results suggest that the formation of a long-lived hyper-massive NS is a rare outcome of NS-NS mergers.

Since there are no known BH-NS binaries, the BH-NS merger rate is even less certain. Bethe \& Brown (1998) argue that BH-NS mergers could be substantially more common than NS-NS mergers, with Bethe et al.~(2007) estimating a rate 10^4 Gpc^-3yr^-1, corresponding to 10^-3 yr^-1 in the Milky Way. Our results rule out such a high rate unless M_d,0 is less than 10^-3M_ . A low average disk mass may be possible, however, because only systems for which the NS-BH mass ratio falls within a fairly narrow range may produce a sizable disk upon merging (e.g., Miller 2005).

The late-time nucleosynthesis in CO merger disks also places interesting constraints on the beaming fraction of short GRBs if most of these events truly result from CO mergers. Using the observed local short GRB rate of 10 Gpc^3 yr^-1 (Nakar et al.~2006) and assuming that the merger rate is proportional to the blue stellar luminosity (Phinney 1991), the short GRB rate in the Milky Way is estimated to be N_ SGRB 10^-6 yr^-1 (Nakar 2007). Thus, if all mergers that produce disks also produce short GRBs, the beaming fraction must obey

f_b N_ SGRB N_ max 0.13 ( 0.2 ) ( M_d,0 0.1M_ ).


This constraint implies that the jet half-opening angle must exceed (2f_b)^1/2 30^ ( /0.2)^1/2(M_d,0/0.1M_ )^1/2. This is consistent with other evidence that short GRBs may be less collimated than long GRBs (e.g., Grupe et al.~2006; Soderberg et al.~2006), which are instead inferred to have 0.002 f_b 0.01 (Frail et al.~2001; Bloom et al.~2003; Guetta, Piran, \& Waxman 2005). Note that equation () is probably a stronger constraint than equation () because only CO mergers that form sizable accretion disks are likely to produce GRBs in the first place.

In addition to material driven from the disk by late time winds, neutron-rich matter may be ejected dynamically during the merger process itself (e.g., Freiburghaus et al.~1999; Rosswog et al.~1999). Although the amount of material ejected in merger calculations depends sensitively on details such as the NS spin and equation of state (Rosswog et al.~1999), the rare isotopes synthesized by this highly neutron-rich ejecta may provide a constraint on the CO merger rate that is comparable to that from late-time outflows given by equation ().

Our conclusion that accretion disks formed from CO mergers freeze out neutron-rich is also consistent with the absence of SN-like longer wavelength transients coincident with these events. If CO merger disks froze out with Y_e^f 0.5 instead of Y_e^f 0.5, their late-time outflows would efficiently synthesize ^56Ni (e.g., Seitenzahl et al.~2008), which could power an optical/infrared transient on day timescales following short-duration GRBs. Despite intensive searches, however, such transients have not yet been observed. For instance, early optical follow-up of the GRB 050509b (Hjorth et al.~2005) limited the amount of ^56Ni to 10^-2M_ (Kulkarni 2005; MPQ08), consistent with the modest amount of material with Y_e^f 0.5 that we find in Figures -. Although we do not expect much ^56Ni to be produced in late-time outflows from CO merger disks, earlier neutrino-driven outflows may produce up to 10^-3 M_ in Ni, which could power a fainter optical or infrared transient (MPQ08). In addition, outflows powered by fall-back accretion onto the BH at late times could power an X-ray transient on a timescale of days to weeks (Rossi \& Begelman 2008).
