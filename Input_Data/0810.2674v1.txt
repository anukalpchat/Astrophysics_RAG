abstract
The combination of several mass-decreasing processes may critically affect the structure of
open clusters (OCs), to the point that most dissolve into the field in a time-scale shorter
than 1\,Gyr. Therefore, as is observed, old OCs should be sparse within the Galaxy.
These mass-decreasing processes can only be quantifiably examined given the derivation of the
fundamental parameters, age, distance and mass, for a sample of old OCs. In this paper we focus
on 4 candidate old star clusters, namely, LK\,1, LK\,10, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555. The first
two clusters, discovered by Le Duigou \& Kn\"odlseder, are projected towards the Cygnus
Association, whilst the remaining two have been detected in the 4th quadrant as cluster
candidates from stellar overdensities by Froebrich, Scholz \& Raftery. To analyse the target
clusters we construct near infrared colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and derive stellar radial
density profiles (RDPs). The CMDs are constructed using 2MASS , , and \ bands, and
the intrinsic morphologies of the target OCs within these diagrams are revealed by applying a
field-star decontamination algorithm. Fundamental parameters are estimated with Padova
isochrones built for the 2MASS filters. We derive extinctions to the objects within the range
3.4 8.9, which makes them suitable for the near-infrared analysis, ages within
1.0 - 2.0\,Gyr, and distances from the Sun within 1.4 - 4.5\,kpc. These distances, in
conjunction with the positions in the sky, place the present 4 OCs close to the solar circle
( 0.6\,kpc). For LK\,10 our photometry reaches a depth 3\,mags below the main
sequence turn off, from which we derive a relatively steep mass function slope ( =2.4 0.4)
when compared to the Salpeter value ( =1.35). LK\,10 is a rather massive old OC, with a
mass within 1360 m( ) 4400, for stars in the observed magnitude range and the
extrapolation to 0.08\, , respectively. The mass estimated in the restricted magnitude range
for the remaining, more distant OCs is within 260 m( ) 380. However, similarity with
the CMD morphology and red clump of LK\,10 suggests that they may be as massive as LK\,10. The RDPs
are well represented by a King-like function, except LK\,10, which has a central cusp suggesting
post-core collapse. Structurally, LK\,1, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,155 are similar to a sample of nearby
OCs of comparable age.

Introduction

The majority of the Galactic open clusters (OCs), the less massive ones in particular, do not
survive the 1\,Gyr age barrier ( Friel95; OldOCs, and references therein).
These systems are affected by several processes that continually change the gravitational potential,
such as mass loss associated with stellar evolution, mass segregation and evaporation, tidal interactions
with the Galactic disc and bulge, and collisions with giant molecular clouds. As clusters age, these
mechanisms accelerate the internal dynamical evolution, which leads to important changes in the structure
and flat, eroded mass functions. In most cases, OCs have their stellar content completely dissolved in the
Galactic field, or leave only poorly-populated remnants ( PB07 and references therein).

Ample evidence gathered on theoretical (e.g. Spitzer58; LG06), N-body (e.g.
BM03; GoBa06; Khalisi07), and observational (e.g. vdB57;
Oort58; vHoerner58; Piskunov07) grounds indicate that, near the Solar circle,
the disruption-time scale ( ) is shorter than 1\,Gyr. The disruption-time scale around the Solar
circle appears to depend on mass as M^0.62 ( LG06). Thus, for clusters with mass
within 10^2 - 10^3 , a disruption time of 75 (Myr) 300 should be expected. In
addition, disruption processes
are stronger for the more centrally located and lower-mass OCs (see OldOCs for a review on
disruption effects and time-scales). Gyr-class OCs are found preferentially near the Solar circle
and in the outer Galaxy (e.g. Friel95; DiskProp), where the frequency of potentially
disrupting dynamical interactions with giant molecular clouds and the disc is lower (e.g. Salaris04;
Upgren72). As an extreme case, inner ( 150\,pc) Galactic tidal fields can dissolve a massive
star cluster in a time-scale as short as 50\,Myr ( Portegies02).

What should be expected from the above scenario is that only a small fraction of the OCs survive the
Gyr age-barrier, with the successful ones spending most of their existences preferentially at large
Galactocentric distances.
Indeed, present-day statistics show that of the 1000 OCs with known age listed in the
WEBDA obswww.univie.ac.at/webda database, 180 are older than 1\,Gyr,
and only 18 ( 2\,\
Additionally, most of the OCs older than 1\,Gyr so far identified are located outside the Solar
circle (see, e.g., the spatial distribution of OCs of different ages in Fig.~1 of OldOCs).

Given the aspects discussed above, a more thorough and wide-ranging exploration of the OC
parameter space - the older ones in particular - is fundamental for a better understanding of
the dynamical process that affect the star clusters. In this sense, it is important to
unambiguously establish the nature of as many old OCs as possible, followed by the derivation
of reliable astrophysical parameters. Such parameters, in turn, can be used in studies of star
formation and evolution processes, dynamics and survival rates of star clusters, the geometry
of the disc, among others.

In the present paper we focus on 4 candidate old OCs, namely, LK\,1, LK\,10, FSR\,1521, and
FSR\,1555. LK\,1 and LK\,10 are projected towards Cygnus and were found by LK2002. An
additional interesting point is to determine whether LK\,1 and/or LK\,10 are part of the Cygnus
Association. FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555 were found as candidate open clusters inferred from stellar
overdensities by FSRcat.

This work employs near-IR , , and \
photometry obtained from the 2MASS The Two Micron All Sky Survey, All Sky data release
( 2mass1997), available at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/ Point
Source Catalogue (PSC). The spatial and photometric uniformity of 2MASS, which allow extraction
of large surrounding fields that provide high star-count statistics, make it an excellent resource
to gather photometric data on a broad variety of star clusters, the wide field ones in particular.
For this purpose we have developed quantitative tools to statistically disentangle cluster evolutionary
sequences from field stars in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which are subsequently used to
investigate the nature of star cluster candidates and to derive astrophysical parameters of the confirmed
clusters (e.g. ProbFSR). Basically, we apply (i) field-star decontamination to quantify
the statistical significance of the CMD morphology, which is fundamental to deriving reddening, age,
and distance from the Sun, and (ii) colour-magnitude filters, which are essential for intrinsic
stellar radial density profiles (RDPs), as well as luminosity and mass functions (MFs). In particular,
the use of field-star decontamination in the construction of CMDs has proved to constrain the age and
distance more than when working with the raw (observed) photometry, especially for low-latitude OCs
( DiskProp).

This paper is organised as follows. In Sect.~ we recall recent additions to the
known old OCs made by our group. Sect.~ contains basic properties and reviews
literature data (where available) on the present star cluster candidates. In Sect.~
we present the 2MASS photometry, build CMDs, and apply the field-star decontamination algorithm.
In Sect.~ we derive cluster fundamental parameters. Sect.~ describes cluster
structure by means of stellar RDPs. In Sect.~ we provide estimates of cluster mass.
In Sect.~ we compare the structural parameters and dynamical state of the present
clusters with those of a sample of nearby OCs, we also discuss effects of the location in
the Galaxy on their structure. Concluding remarks are given in Sect.~.

Recent additions to the known population of old OCs

In recent years our group has been systematically analysing infrared clusters or candidates,
establishing their nature and deriving cluster fundamental parameters with the 2MASS catalogue
(e.g. ProbFSR). We make use of a field decontamination algorithm (described in
Sect.~) to statistically extract estimated cluster sequences from CMDs. Especially
for crowded fields, the cluster sequence isolation requires some form of membership selection
(e.g. OldOCs). Old OCs are intrinsically rarer than young clusters
(Sect.~), but the 2MASS catalogue, coupled to the statistical tools that we have
developed to deal with clusters and comparison fields allow the detection (and derivation
of reliable astrophysical parameters) of older OCs (e.g. OldOCs; F1603).

Recently, FSRcat provided a catalogue of star cluster candidates corresponding to 1021 stellar
overdensities detected in the 2MASS database. This catalogue covers |b|<20 and all Galactic
longitudes, and has become an important source of new star clusters. Several followup studies have
explored the FSR catalogue with different approaches, revealing new globular clusters, such as
FSR\,1735 ( FSR1735) and FSR\,1767 ( FSR1767), and the probable GCs FSR\,584
( FSR584) and FSR\,190 ( FSR190). We show in Table~ 14 recent
identifications of old OCs made by our group. Three of them are optical objects, while the remaining
11 are infrared ones. Compared to the DAML02 http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~wilton/ optical
catalogue of OCs, our results increased the known sample of old OCs by 5\

In the present paper we merge the old OCs in Table~ with the classical
optical old OCs (WEBDA) for comparison purposes with the 4 objects dealt with in this
paper. This analysis is given in Sect.~.

The target clusters

LK2002 provided a list of 17 star clusters and candidates in the Cygnus direction. As they point
out, 12 of these objects (hereafter designated by LK) had already been found by DB2001. Most of
the LK objects appear to be embedded clusters, but some of them, like LK\,1 and LK\,10, have features
typical of older clusters. With 2MASS photometry, they were able to estimate some cluster parameters.
For LK\,1 they derived a radius (containing 90\
modulus DM=11.0, the absorption in the K band A_K=1.0 - 2.0, and a mass within M=1100-3130\, ;
they suggested that LK\,1 may be a rather evolved cluster. As for LK\,10, they found R_90=6 7,
DM=11.0, A_K=0.6 - 1.2, M=1010-4100\, , a rather steep mass function (MF:
(m) m^-(1+ )) slope =1.98 0.25, and suggested that it is quite evolved.
Near-infrared 2MASS \ images of LK\,1 and LK\,10, covering 5 5 fields, are shown
in Fig.~ (top panels).

FSR\,1521 was classified by FSRcat as a highly probable star cluster candidate. They derived
the core and tidal radii (measured in 2MASS \ images) R_c^H=1 6 and R_t^H=25 3,
respectively. FSR\,1521 can be seen in the 5 5 \ image shown in Fig.~
(bottom-left panel).

FSR\,1555 was also classified as a highly probable star cluster candidate by FSRcat, who
derived R_c^H=1 7 and R_t^H=11 6 for this object. FSR\,1555 is shown in the
5 5 \ image shown in Fig.~ (bottom-right panel). In general,
the clusters in the present sample are very contaminated by field stars, which requires specific
tools to analyse them.

Table~ provides fundamental data on the objects, where the literature coordinates are given
in cols.~2 and 3. However, when we built the RDPs based on these coordinates (Sect.~), we
noticed that, in all cases,
the coordinates where the maximum stellar number-density occurs are slightly shifted with respect to
the literature positions. Thus, hereafter we will refer as cluster coordinates those that maximise
the central stellar density (given in cols.~4-7). The age, central reddening, distance from the Sun,
Galactocentric distance, and the components projected onto the Galactic plane derived in the present
study (Sect.~) are given in Cols.~8 to 14.

Colour-magnitude diagrams with 2MASS photometry

Photometry in the 2MASS , , and \ bands was extracted in circular fields of radius
\ centred on the coordinates of the objects (Table~) by means of VizieR
http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=II/246. \ should be large enough to allow
the determination of the background level (Sect.~). In the present cases, =30
(FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555), =40 (LK\,1), and =60 (LK\,10), which are considerably
larger than the cluster radius (Sect.~ and col.~5 of Table~). Previous works with
OCs in different environments (Sect.~) have shown that in the absence of a populous neighbouring
cluster and significant differential absorption (Sect.~), wide extraction areas provide
the necessary statistics for a consistent colour and magnitude characterisation of the field stars. For
decontamination purposes, comparison fields were extracted within wide rings located beyond the cluster
radii. As photometric quality constraint, the 2MASS extractions were restricted to stars (i) brighter
than those of the 99.9\
Level\,1 Requirement, at http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/ in the cluster
direction, and (ii) with errors in , , and \ smaller than 0.3\,mag. The 99.9\
limits refer to field stars, and depend on Galactic coordinates. For the present clusters, the fraction
of stars with , , and \ uncertainties smaller than 0.06\,mag is 80\
of uncertainties as a function of magnitude, for clusters projected towards the central parts of the Galaxy,
can be found in BB07. Reddening transformations use the relations A_J/A_V=0.276, A_H/A_V=0.176,
A_K_S/A_V=0.118, and A_J=2.76 ( DSB2002), for a constant total-to-selective
absorption ratio R_V=3.1. These ratios were derived from the extinction curve of Cardelli89.

CMDs displaying the and colours built with the raw photometry of the
present clusters are shown in Figs.~ - (top panels). For all clusters, the sampled
region is larger than the respective core (Table~). When qualitatively compared with the CMDs
extracted from the equal-area comparison fields (middle panels), features typical of old OCs are
apparent. A relatively populous red clump (at 13.8 14.7 and 1.3 1.5) and a
main-sequence turn off (MSTO) stand out over the field contamination of LK\,1 (Fig.~). A
somewhat less-populous red clump (11.3 12.7, 1.2 1.5) and about 3 MS mags
( 13.4) are seen in LK\,10 (Fig.~). LK\,1 (Fig.~), FSR\,1521
(Fig.~), and FSR\,1555 (Fig.~) present similar CMDs, with clear red clumps, the
MSTO, and about 1 mag of the MS below. The red clump of FSR\,1521 occurs at 12.3 13.2 and
0.8 1.0, while for FSR\,1555 it is at 12.3 13.5 and 0.7 1.0.

Finally, we show in Figs.~ and the spatial distribution of the stellar surface-density
as measured in the 2MASS photometry. We compute the surface density (in units of
stars\,arcmin^-2), in a rectangular mesh with cells of dimensions 3 3 . The meshes
reach total offsets of | |=| | 20 with respect to the centre
(Table~), in right ascension and declination; for LK\,10 we use offsets of 30 . In all
clusters, the core (Table~) is contained in the central cell.

With respect to the surface-densities built with the observed (raw) photometry (top panels of Figs.~
and ), an important excess appears in the central cell, except for LK\,10 which, because of the
contamination by disc stars, presents a rather irregular distribution. FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555, on the
other hand, clearly detach in the central cell (Fig.~) against more uniform surrounding
fields. As shown in the bottom panels, the cluster overdensities are clearly enhanced with respect to the
surroundings in the field-star decontaminated surfaces (Sect.~).

Field-star decontamination

As expected of low-latitude clusters (Table~), the stellar surface-density in the direction
of the objects (Figs.~ and ) clearly shows that field-star contamination,
essentially from disc stars, should be taken into account. This fact is confirmed by the qualitative
comparison between the CMDs extracted within the cluster and in the field (Figs.~-).
Thus, the field-star contribution should be quantified in each case to better define the intrinsic CMD
morphology.

Field-star decontamination is a very important, yet difficult, step in the identification and
characterisation of star clusters. Several approaches have been used to this purpose (e.g.
Mercer05), and most of them are based essentially on two different premises. The first works
with spatial variations of the star-count density, but does not take into account CMD properties. In
the latter, stars in a CMD extracted from an assumed cluster region are subtracted according to colour
and magnitude similarity with the stars of an equal-area comparison field CMD. These methods,
together with the one we work with, are based on photometric properties only. Ideally, more robust
results on cluster membership determination would be obtained if another independent parameter, such
as the proper motion of member and comparison field stars, is taken into account. However, for proper
motions to be useful the target cluster should be relatively close (e.g. AMD03) and/or to
have been observed in widely-apart epochs, preferentially with high resolution, such as in the case
of the globular cluster NGC\,6397 ( Richer08). Neither condition is satisfied for the present
clusters, which are relatively distant (Sect.~) and have been observed by 2MASS in a single
epoch.

Description of the algorithm

We work with the statistical algorithm introduced by BB07 to deal with the field-star
contamination in CMDs. The algorithm takes into account simultaneously star-count density and
colour/magnitude similarity between cluster and comparison field. It measures the relative number
densities of probable field and
cluster stars in cubic CMD cells whose axes correspond to the \ magnitude and the \ and \
colours These are the 2MASS colours that provide the maximum variance among CMD sequences for
OCs of different ages (e.g. TheoretIsoc).. The algorithm: (i) divides the full range of
magnitude and colours covered by the CMD into a 3D grid, (ii) calculates the expected number
density of field stars in each cell based on the number of comparison field stars with similar magnitude
and colours as those in the cell, and (iii) subtracts the expected number of field stars from each
cell. By construction, the algorithm is sensitive to local field-star contamination
( BB07). Typical cell dimensions are =1.0, and = =0.25, which are
large enough to allow sufficient star-count statistics in individual cells and small enough to preserve
the CMD morphology. The comparison fields are located within R=20 -
40 (LK\,1), R=30 -60 (LK\,10), and R=15 -30
(FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555).
The inner boundary of the comparison field lies beyond the probable tidal radius
(Sect.~), which minimises the probability of oversubtraction of cluster stars. We emphasise
that the equal-area field extractions (middle panels of Figs.~ - ) should be taken
only for qualitative comparisons. The decontamination is based on the large surrounding area as described
above. Further details on the algorithm are given in BB07.

As discussed in BB07, differential reddening between cluster and field stars may be critical
for the decontamination algorithm. Important gradients would require large cell sizes or, in extreme cases,
preclude application of the algorithm altogether. Basically, it would be required colour differences of
| | cell~size (0.25, in the present work) between cluster and comparison field for the
differential reddening to affect the subtraction in a given cell. However, the cluster and comparison field
CMDs (Figs.~-) indicate that differential reddening is not important for the present
sample.

Decontamination statistics

Additional statistical analysis is required because of the relatively high reddening values
(Table~) affecting the clusters. In Table~ we present the full statistics of the
decontamination, discriminated by magnitude bins. Statistically relevant parameters are: (i) \
which, for a given magnitude bin, corresponds to the ratio of the decontaminated number of stars to the
1 Poisson fluctuation of the number of observed stars, (ii) , which is related to
the probability that the decontaminated stars result from the normal star count fluctuation in the comparison
field and, (iii) , which measures the star-count uniformity of the comparison field. Properties of
, , and , measured in OCs and field fluctuations are discussed in ProbFSR. Table~
also provides integrated values of the above parameters, which correspond to the full magnitude range spanned
by the CMD of each OC. The spatial regions are those sampled by the CMDs shown in the top panels
of Figs.~-.

CMDs of star clusters should have integrated \ values significantly higher than 1 ( ProbFSR),
a condition that is met for the present objects ( =6.1-8.9). As a further test of the statistical significance
of the above results, we investigate star count properties of the field stars. First, the comparison field
is divided into 8 sectors around the cluster centre. Next, we compute the parameter , which is the
1\, Poisson fluctuation around the mean of the star counts measured in the 8 sectors (corrected
for the different areas of the sectors and cluster extraction). In a spatially uniform comparison field,
\ is expected to be very small. Thus, OCs should have the probable number of member
stars ( ) higher than 3\, , to minimise the probability that \ arises from fluctuations of a
non-uniform comparison field. This condition is fully satisfied by the present clusters, reaching the level
(5-10)\, . We also provide in Table~ the parameter . For a given magnitude bin we
first compute the average number of stars over all sectors N and the corresponding
1 fluctuation _ N ; thus, \ is defined as = _
N / N . Non uniformities such as heavy differential reddening should result in high
values of . On the other hand, \ is low ( 0.09), except for LK\,10 ( =0.21), which reflects a rather
irregular field (Fig.~). Finally, we note that the number of decontaminated stars in most magnitude
bins is larger than what could be expected from field-star fluctuations ( 3 ).

Since we usually work with comparison fields larger than the possible-cluster extractions, the correction
for the different spatial areas between field and cluster is expected to produce a fractional number
of probable field stars (n_fs^cell) in some cells. Before the cell-by-cell subtraction, the
fractional numbers are rounded off to the nearest integer, but limited to the number of observed stars
in each cell n_sub^cell=NI(n_fs^cell) n_obs^cell, where NI represents rounding off to
the nearest integer). The global effect is quantified by means of the difference between the expected number
of field stars in each cell (n_fs^cell) and the actual number of subtracted stars (n_sub^cell).
Summed over all cells, this quantity provides an estimate of the total subtraction efficiency of the
process, \[ f_sub=100 _celln_sub^cell/ _celln_fs^cell~~~~~(\
results would be obtained for an efficiency f_sub 100\
decontamination of the present clusters, the subtraction efficiencies turned out to be higher than 90\

Decontaminated CMDs and surface densities

As an indicator of the algorithm efficiency we can take the decontaminated stellar surface-density
distributions (bottom panels of Figs.~ and ). The central excesses have been
significantly enhanced with respect to the raw photometry (top panels), while the residual
surface-density around the centre has been reduced to a minimum level. By design, the decontamination
depends essentially on the colour-magnitude distribution of stars located in different spatial regions.
The fact that the decontaminated surface-density presents a conspicuous excess only at the assumed
cluster position implies significant differences among this region and the comparison field, both in
terms of colour-magnitude and number of stars within the corresponding colour-magnitude bins. This
meets the expectations of star clusters, which can be characterised by a
single-stellar population, projected against a Galactic stellar field.

The decontaminated CMDs are shown in the bottom panels of Figs.~ - . As expected,
essentially all of the disc contamination is removed, leaving stellar sequences typical of reddened
old OCs, with well-developed red clumps and different extents of the MS.

As a caveat, we cannot exclude the possibility of differential reddening to account for part
of the observed spread in the CMD distribution of stars. To examine this issue we show, in the
bottom panels of Figs.~-, reddening vectors computed with the 2MASS ratios
(Sect.~) for a standard visual absorption =2. Given the absorptions derived for
the clusters (Table~), the standard value, which represents from 25\
50\
Together with the decontaminated CMDs, this experiment suggests that differential reddening in
all cases is not large, because the giant clumps are rather tight, while the MS spread appears
to be dominated by photometric errors. The typical dependence of the 2MASS photometric errors on
magnitude, for objects projected along different directions, is discussed in OldOCs.

We conclude that the qualitative and quantitative expectations of the decontamination algorithm have
been satisfied by the output. In all cases, the decontaminated photometry presents a conspicuous excess,
with respect to the surroundings, in the surface-density distribution (Figs.~ and ).
In addition, field-decontaminated CMDs extracted from the spatial regions where the excesses occur
(Figs.~-), present statistically significant (Table~) cluster CMDs.

Cluster age, reddening, and distance

The field-decontaminated CMD morphologies derived in Sect.~ can be used to compute the
cluster fundamental parameters. We work with Padova isochrones ( Girardi2002) computed
with the 2MASS , , and \ filters http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd -
Bolometric and colour corrections were computed for a set of isochrones using the 2MASS filter
responses. The isochrones were subsequently provided in the Vega Mag system.. The updated isochrones
are very similar to the Johnson-Kron-Cousins ones (e.g. BesBret88), with differences of at
most 0.01 in \ ( TheoretIsoc). Distinctive features of the updated isochrone set are
centred mostly on the greatly-improved treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch
(TP-AGB) phase. According to Marigo08, the updated isochrones are intended to preserve the
several peculiarities present in the TP-AGB tracks, namely, the cool tails of C-type stars due to the
use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB, the bell-shaped
sequences in the HR diagram for stars with hot-bottom burning, the changes of pulsation mode between
fundamental and first overtone, the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface chemistry
changes from M- to C-type, etc. Because it is important to derive, or at least set constraints on
astrophysical parameters of old star clusters, we adopt as working strategy the search for solutions
within a range of ages and metallicities. As discussed by, e.g. Friel95, OC metallicities in
general range from Solar ([Fe/H]=0, or Z=0.019) to sub-Solar ([Fe/H]=-0.5, Z=0.006, or
1/3 Solar) values. According to the metallicity gradient (Fig.~7 in Friel95), the
present OCs fall around the locus occupied by OCs with metallicity [Fe/H] -0.1. Thus we base
the following analysis on this most probable value. To compute Galactocentric distances, we adopt
=7.2 0.3\,kpc ( GCProp) as the Sun's distance to the Galactic centre. This value
was derived by means of the GC spatial distribution Other recent studies gave similar results,
e.g. =7.2 0.9\,kpc ( Eisen03), =7.62 0.32\,kpc ( Eisen05) and
=7.52 0.10\,kpc ( Nishiyama06), with different approaches..

Historically, different approaches have been used to extract astrophysical parameters from
CMDs by means of isochrone fits. The simplest ones are based on a direct comparison of a set
of isochrones with the CMD morphology, while the more sophisticated include photometric
uncertainties, binarism, and variations on metallicity. Most of these methods are summarised in
NJ06, in which a maximum-likelihood CMD fit method is described.

For simplicity, in the present cases fits are made by eye, with the tight giant clumps as
the strongest constraint. We also require that, because of the potential presence of binaries,
the adopted isochrone should be shifted somewhat to the left of the MS fiducial line, i.e. a
median line that takes into account the MS spread, including the photometric uncertainties as
well (e.g. N188, and references therein). In the following Section we discuss each
cluster individually.

FSR\,1521

The decontaminated CMD morphology of FSR\,1521 (Fig.~) shows a concentration of
stars at 15, which indicates a relatively populous MSTO of an old cluster detected near
the 2MASS photometric limit. Besides, a distinctive red clump shows up at 12.5 and
0.9. Taken together, these stellar sequences characterise a distant old OC.

Allowing as well for the photometric uncertainties, acceptable fits to the decontaminated
CMD morphology are obtained with the 2\,Gyr isochrone, with an uncertainty of 0.5\,Gyr. This can
be seen in Fig.~, in which we compare solutions with the ages 1.5, 2, and 2.5\,Gyr, both for
Solar and sub-Solar ([Fe/H]=-0.5) metallicities. Ages younger than about 1.5\,Gyr would produce a
significantly poorer description (much fainter than observed) of the red clump, while those older
than about 2.5\,Gyr, would be
prohibitively shifted to the right of the MSTO. In any case, both metallicity ranges provide similar
fits to the decontaminated morphology. Since the remaining OCs have ages (Table~) and CMDs
with photometric uncertainties similar to those of FSR\,1521, the above test shows that any
metallicity within 1/3 Z/Z_ 1 would produce acceptable solutions. Thus, for simplicity
and because the present OCs are relatively near the Solar circle, we adopt the Solar-metallicity isochrones
as more probable solutions.

We caution that, because of the 2MASS photometric uncertainties for the lower sequences,
a more sophisticated approach for isochrone fitting might produce an overinterpretation. For
this reason, we apply the above method for all objects.

With the adopted solution, the fundamental parameters of FSR\,1521 are the near-infrared reddening
=0.34 0.05, which corresponds to =1.1 0.2, or
A_V=3.4 0.5, the observed and absolute distance moduli =14.2 0.3 and =13.26 0.33,
respectively, and the distance from the Sun =4.5 0.7\,kpc. Thus, for =7.2\,kpc, the
Galactocentric distance of FSR\,1521 is =7.8 0.4\,kpc, which puts it 0.6\,kpc outside
the Solar circle. This solution is shown in Fig.~ (bottom panels).

We call attention that the best fit takes into account strong constraints provided by the
tight distribution of the clump giants, which preserves accuracy especially for the reddening
and distance. Thus, the resulting uncertainties are adopted as the most probable errors, which
are subsequently propagated to the different sets of parameters (Tables~ and
). However, given the uncertainties in the faint-photometric end, age is less
constrained.

LK\,1

The best-fit to the CMD of LK\,1 was obtained with the 1\,Gyr isochrone, =0.90 0.03 and
=15.5 0.2. Taking into account fit uncertainties we derive the age 1.0 0.2\,Gyr,
=2.9 0.1, A_V=8.9 0.3, =13.02 0.22, =4.0 0.4\,kpc, and =7.3 0.2\,kpc.
LK\,1 is 0.1\,kpc outside the Solar circle. This solution is shown in the bottom panels of
Fig.~. It represents well the MSTO, red clump and giant branch, in both colours. The few stars
bluer than the MSTO might be blue stragglers or un-subtracted field stars. Our derived distance
modulus is about 2 mags fainter than that adopted by LK2002.

With 1-2\,kpc as the distance to the Cygnus Association (e.g. LK2002; BBD2003),
LK\,1, at 4\,kpc, is a distant background old open cluster in the line of sight of
that association.

LK\,10

The decontaminated CMD morphology of LK\,10 (Fig.~) is somewhat more constrained than that
of LK\,1. Besides a tight red clump, it features about a 3 mag MS extent. Fundamental parameters of
LK\,10 are an age 1.0 0.1\,Gyr, =0.86 0.02, which corresponds to =2.8 0.1 and
A_V=8.5 0.3, =13.1 0.1, =10.7 0.11, =1.4 0.1\,kpc, and =7.1 0.1\,kpc.
LK\,10 lies 0.1\,kpc inside the Solar circle. Our derived distance modulus agrees with that
adopted by LK2002.

With 1.4\,kpc, LK\,10 might be spatially coincident with the Cygnus Association. However,
they must not share a common origin, since LK\,10 is much older than the estimated age of the
Cygnus Association, 1-4\,Myr (e.g. Massey95). Despite the different distances, LK\,1 and
LK\,10 are affected essentially by the same reddening value.

FSR\,1555

With the MSTO and red clump detected in the decontaminated CMD of FSR\,1555 (Fig.~), we derive
an age 1.5 0.5\,Gyr, =0.37 0.02, which corresponds to =1.2 0.1 and A_V=3.7 0.3,
=14.1 0.1, =13.08 0.11, =4.1 0.2\,kpc, and =7.1 0.1\,kpc. FSR\,1555 lies
0.1\,kpc inside the Solar circle.

Cluster structure

Structural parameters are derived by means of the projected radial density profiles (RDP) built
with the stellar number density around the cluster centre. Usually, star clusters have RDPs that
follow a well-defined analytical profile. Among these are the empirical, single mass, modified
isothermal sphere of King66, the modified isothermal sphere of Wilson75, which
assumes a pre-defined stellar distribution function (and produces more extended envelopes than
King 1966), and the power law with a core of EFF87. These functions are characterised
by different parameters that are related to cluster structure. However, considering the error
bars of the present RDPs (Fig.~), we adopt the analytical
function (R)= _bg+ _0/(1+(R/R_c)^2), where _bg is the residual
background density, _0 is the central density of stars, and \ is the core radius. This
function is similar to that introduced by to describe the surface brightness profiles
in the central parts of globular clusters. As discussed in StrucPar, RDPs built with
depth-limited photometry produce structural radii comparable to the intrinsic (i.e. derived
with deep photometry) ones.

table*

To minimise noise in the RDPs, we first apply a colour-magnitude filter to the photometry, which
excludes stars with colours unlike those of the cluster sequence. Colour-magnitude
filters are wide enough to include cluster MS and evolved star colour distributions, as well as the
1 photometric uncertainties Colour-magnitude filter widths should also account for
formation or dynamical evolution-related effects, such as enhanced fractions of binaries (and other
multiple systems) towards the central parts of clusters, since such systems tend to widen the MS
(e.g. HT98; Kerber02; BB07; N188).. The colour-magnitude
filters for the present OCs are shown in the bottom-left panels of Figs.~-.
However, residual field stars with colours similar to those of the cluster are expected to remain
inside the colour-magnitude filter. They affect the intrinsic stellar RDP in a way that
depends on the relative densities of field and cluster stars. The contribution of the residual
contamination to the observed RDP is statistically subtracted by means of the field. As a
result, the use of colour-magnitude filters enhances the contrast of the RDP
with respect to the background, especially in crowded fields (e.g. BB07).

Oversampling near the centre and undersampling at large radii are avoided by using rings
of increasing width with distance from the cluster centre. A typical set of ring widths is
\,R=0.5,\ 1,\ 2.5,\ and\ 5 , respectively for 0 R<1 ,
1 R<4 , 4 R<10 , and R 10 . The number and
width of the rings can be set to produce RDPs with adequate spatial resolution and small
1 Poisson errors. The residual background level of each RDP corresponds to the average
number of colour-magnitude filtered stars measured in the field. The R coordinate (and
uncertainty) of each ring corresponds to the average position and standard deviation of the
stars inside the ring.

The colour-magnitude filtered RDPs of the present clusters are shown in Fig.~, where we
also show the profiles produced with the observed (raw) photometry. As expected,
minimisation of the number of non-cluster stars by the colour-magnitude filter resulted in RDPs with
higher contrast with respect to the background. Fits of the King-like profile were performed with a
non-linear least-squares fit routine that uses errors as weights. To minimise degrees of freedom,
_0 and \ were derived from the RDP fit, while _bg is measured in the field.
The best-fit solutions are shown in Fig.~, and the fit parameters are given in Table~.
For absolute comparison with other clusters, Table~ also presents parameters in absolute
units, based on the cluster distances (Sect.~). Because of
the 2MASS photometric limit, which for the present clusters corresponds to a cutoff for stars brighter
than 16.5, _0 should be taken as a lower limit.

Within uncertainties, the adopted King-like function describes well the colour-magnitude filtered RDPs
along the full radius range, especially for LK\,1, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555. The exception is LK\,10,
which shows a marked excess in the central region.
This central cusp in LK\,10 suggests a post-core collapse phase in this 1\,Gyr OC, as detected
in part of the globular clusters (e.g. TKD95). Such a central cusp has been observed in the
RDP of other OCs, such as NGC\,3960 ( N3960).

We also estimate the cluster radius ( ) by visually comparing the RDP level (and fluctuations) with
the background. It corresponds to the distance from the cluster centre where RDP and background are
statistically indistinguishable (e.g. DetAnalOCs, and references therein). Thus, most of the
cluster stars are contained within , which should not be mistaken for the tidal radius. Tidal radii
are derived from, e.g. the 3-parameter King-profile fit to RDPs (see below), which requires large
surrounding fields and adequate Poisson errors. For instance, in populous and relatively high Galactic
latitude OCs such as M\,67, NGC\,188, and NGC\,2477, cluster radii are a factor 0.5 - 0.7 of the
respective tidal radii ( DetAnalOCs). The factor is somewhat lower for low-Galactic latitude
objects, because of the enhanced background. The cluster radii of the present objects are given in
cols.~5 (angular scale) and 12 (absolute scale) of Table~.

Table~ (col.~7) provides the density contrast parameter _c=1+ _0/ _bg,
which, for the present clusters is relatively high (3.3< _c<8.5). Since _c is measured
in colour-magnitude-filtered (lower noise) RDPs, it is usually higher than the visual contrast produced
by images (e.g. Fig.~).

Alternatively, we tried to fit the RDPs with the 3-parameter function (based on King1962)
$ (R)= _0 [ 1 1+(R/R_c)^2- 1 1+(R_t/R_c)^2 ]^2,
which includes the tidal radius ( ). However, convergence occurred only for LK\,1, with
=18.3 5.5 . With such radii, the concentration parameter of LK\,1 is
c= ( / ) 1.5 which, compared to the Galactic (non-core collapse) globular clusters,
puts it around the median value (e.g. Pap11GCs).
Qualitatively, the 3-parameter fit to the RDP of LK\,1 is indistinguishable to that shown in
Fig.~, within the uncertainties. Thus, we simply show in panel (c) the position of the
tidal radius.

Interestingly, the cluster radii of LK\,1 and LK\,10 given by LK2002 are about half those
derived in this work. This probably occurs because we work with colour-magnitude-filtered RDPs,
which enhances the cluster/background contrast and probes larger cluster extensions. With
respect to FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555, our values for the core radius are about 1/3 of those given by
FSRcat, while our \ is consistent with their , given the above relation between
both radii.

Compared to the distribution of core radius derived for a sample of relatively nearby OCs by
Piskunov07, the present OCs, especially FSR\,1521, occupy the small- \ tail. Besides,
for a relation between tidal and cluster radius as 2 , LK\,10, FSR\,1521, and
FSR\,155 are located around the median value, while LK\,1 occupies the large- \ tail.

Mass estimates

Since we detect 3 mags of the MS of LK\,10, we can build its mass function
( (m)= dNdm ) and compute the mass stored in stars. We work with colour-magnitude filtered
photometry, the 3 2MASS bands separately, and the mass-luminosity relation obtained from the corresponding
Padova isochrone and distance from the Sun (Sect.~). Further details on MF construction are given
in FaintOCs. The effective MS stellar mass range is 1.15 m( ) 1.80.

The MF of LK\,10 is well represented by the function (m) m^-(1+ ), with
the slope =2.4 0.4. Within uncertainties, this slope agrees with =1.98 0.25
derived by LK2002. Both values are steeper than the =1.35 of
Salpeter55 initial mass function (IMF).

The number of observed MS and evolved stars in LK\,10 (for R ) is derived by counting the
stars (in the background-subtracted colour-magnitude filtered photometry) that are present in the
mag ranges, 13.4< <16.4 for the MS and <13.4 for the evolved stars. There are
n_MS=959 20 and n_evol=25 8, MS and evolved stars, respectively; the corresponding
mass values are m_MS=1311 26\, and m_evol=46 16\, . The evolved star mass corresponds
to n_evol multiplied by the stellar mass at the TO, m_TO=1.8\, . Thus, the observed stellar
mass of LK\,10 is m_obs 1360\, , which agrees with the equivalent value estimated by
LK2002.

Finally, we estimate the total stellar mass by extrapolating the observed MF down to the H-burning
mass limit (0.08\, ). We follow the universal IMF of Kroupa2001, which assumes increasing
flattening towards low-mass stars. This IMF is described by the slopes =0.3 0.5 for the range
0.08 m( ) 0.5 and =1.3 0.3 for 0.5 m( ) 1.0. We obtain
m_extr=4420 2000\, . Thus, the stellar mass of LK\,10 can be put in the range
1360-4420\, . Again, within uncertainties, the upper value is consistent with that
estimated by LK2002.

Because of the limited MS range, only estimates of the observed cluster mass are made for
the remaining objects, by means of the age solutions given in Sect.~. In all cases
we consider the region within R (Table~). For LK\,1 we derive
m_MS=108 9\, and m_evol=270 26\, , which leads to the total observed mass
m_obs 380\, . This value corresponds to about 1/3 of the estimate given by
LK2002. The values for FSR\,1555 are m_MS=123 9\, , m_evol=139 16\, ,
and m_obs 260\, . Since FSR\,1555 and LK\,1 are approximately at the same distance
from the Sun, the latter appears to be somewhat more massive than the former.

With the more probable solution (2\,Gyr) for FSR\,1521, the total number of stars present in
R 5.2 CMD is n_tot 161, of which 18 are in the red clump
and 111 in the MSTO. Thus, for a MSTO mass of 1.63\, , the observed
mass of FSR\,1521 is m_obs 262\, , of which 81\, correspond to the
evolved stars, and 29\, are stored in the red clump. Interestingly, while the observed
mass of FSR\,1521 is similar to that of FSR\,1555, the evolved mass is somewhat lower. Since both
OCs are at comparable distances, this difference is consistent with the relative ages.

The fact that LK\,1, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,155 present similar observed masses as LK\,10, suggest
that they all might be as massive as the latter OC.

Given the accuracy of the isochrone best-fit for old OCs provided by near-infrared
decontaminated CMDs, e.g. Fig.~ and related discussions, the observed masses
are expected to be representative. Of course, deeper near-infrared photometry coupled to
similar methods as the present one, and/or including proper motion filtering, would
produce more constrained results.

Discussion

With the analyses of the preceding sections we have gathered important clues to establish that the
objects dealt with in this paper are Gyr-class OCs, or older. We also derived representative,
i.e. constrained by means of the isochrone fit (Sect.~), fundamental
and structural parameters, most of which have been derived for the first time. We use these
parameters to put the clusters into perspective, by comparing some of their properties with those
of a set of well-studied OCs.

As reference we take the nearby OCs with ages in the range 70-7\,000\,Myr and masses within
400-5\,300\, \ studied by DetAnalOCs, together with the young OCs NGC\,6611 ( N6611)
and NGC\,4755 ( N4755). The reference clusters are distinguished according to total mass (higher
or lower than 1\,000\, ). DetAnalOCs discuss parameter correlations in the reference sample.

As shown in panel (a) of Fig.~, the core and cluster radii of the reference OCs are related
by =(8.9 0.3) R_ core^(1.0 0.1), which suggests a similar scaling for both kinds of
radii, at least for the radii ranges 0.2 (pc) 1.5 and 2 (pc) 15. LK\,1, LK\,10,
FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555 fit tightly in the relation. They also appear to follow the trend of increasing
cluster radii with Galactocentric distance (panel b). This kind of dependence was previously suggested by,
e.g. Lynga82. Part of this relation may be primordial, in the sense that the higher molecular gas
density in central Galactic regions may have produced clusters with small radii, as suggested by
vdB91 to explain the increase of globular cluster radii with Galactocentric distance. After
formation, mass loss associated with stellar and dynamical evolution (such as mass segregation and
evaporation), together with tidal interactions with the Galactic potential and giant molecular clouds,
also contribute to the depletion of star clusters, especially the low-mass and centrally located ones
(Sect.~). A similar dependence on Galactocentric distance for \ is implied by the
data shown in panel (a).

In panels (c) and (d) of Fig.~ we compare the presently derived cluster and core radii
with those of the reference sample in terms of age. LK\,1, LK\,10, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555 have
core and cluster radii similar to those measured in the reference OCs of equivalent age.

We show in Fig.~ the spatial distribution of LK\,1, LK\,10, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555,
as they lay in the Galactic plane. The spiral arm structure of the Milky Way is based on
GalStr and DrimSper01, as derived from HII regions, and molecular clouds (e.g.
Russeil03). The Galactic bar is shown with an orientation of 14 \ and 6\,kpc in
total length ( Freuden98; Vallee05). The present OCs are compared to the spatial
distribution of the OCs with known age given in the WEBDA database. For comparison purposes we consider
two age groups, clusters younger and older than 1\,Gyr (the old OCs listed in Table~
are merged into this group). As expected, old OCs are found preferentially outside the Solar circle,
while the inner Galaxy contains few OCs so far detected. Besides, because of the presence of bright
stars, young OCs can be detected farther than the old ones, especially towards the central region.
As discussed in DiskProp, central
directions farther than 2\,kpc begin to be critically affected by incompleteness (due to
crowding and high backround levels) and enhanced disruption rates, while the drop in the number of
OCs towards the opposite direction appears to be mostly real. Also, all directions show depletion
in the number of detected OCs farther than 2\,kpc. Considering the overall distribution,
the pairs LK\,1 and LK\,10, and FSR\,1521 and FSR\,1555 probe basically unexplored regions,
in opposite directions. FSR\,1555, and especially FSR\,1521, are located close to the
Carina-Sagittarius Arm. LK\,1 and LK\,10 are found between the Carina-Sagittarius and Orion-Cygnus
arms.

Summary and conclusions

Accurate fundamental and structural parameters of old star clusters are important for
reasons that range from the completeness of the open cluster parameter space to the determination
of the efficiency of cluster dissolution mechanisms. Taken together, the results of the present
paper, and those of previous works by our group (Table~), add to a total of
18 old (age 0.8\,Gyr) open clusters with reliable In the context discussed
in Sect.~, with uncertainties propagated from the best-fitting 2MASS isochrones.
parameters derived, for the first time for most of them. New findings and the age-determination
within a reasonable confidence level are important as well to improve the statistical coverage
of the open cluster databases, especially for the definition of the old-age tail of the open
cluster age-distribution function.

In this paper we use colour-magnitude diagrams and radial density profiles to derive
fundamental and structural parameters of the infrared open clusters LK\,1 and
LK\,10, as well as of the star cluster candidates FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555. Our approach
is essentially based on field-star decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which enhances cluster
CMD evolutionary sequences, and produces more constrained parameters.

We present consistent evidence, in the form of CMD morphology, statistical tests, structural
parameters, and comparison with nearby OCs, that the objects are Gyr-class open clusters. With
absorptions in the range 3.4 8.9, the objects are well suited for the 2MASS photometry.
They are located at 4\,kpc from the Sun, except for the relatively nearby LK\,10,
which is at 1.4\,kpc.
The 4 clusters are within 0.6\,kpc from the Solar circle. The old ages of LK\,1 and LK\,10
(and the distance of the former) preclude a common origin with the Cygnus Association. With a mass
function slope ( =2.4 0.4) somewhat steeper than Salpeter's ( =1.35), LK\,10 is
relatively massive, with a total mass within 1360 m( ) 4400. The remaining clusters
present CMD morphology and observed mass (within 260 m( ) 380$) similar to those of
LK\,10, which suggests that they may be old clusters as massive as LK\,10. This is consistent
especially with the relatively well-populated red clumps.

Structurally, LK\,1, FSR\,1521, and FSR\,1555 are characterised by core and cluster radii
similar to those of a sample of nearby open clusters of comparable age. This is consistent
with the fact that, because they are relatively close to the Solar circle, they suffer similar
tidal stresses. LK\,10, on the other hand, presents evidence of post-core collapse, a structure
already observed in other old OCs, such as NGC\,3960 ( N3960).

Finally, we note that systematic searches in catalogues of star cluster candidates, coupled
with an efficient field-star decontamination algorithm, can provide important additions
the the known population of open clusters, old ones in particular.
