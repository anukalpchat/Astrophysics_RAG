abstract
Hyper-accretion disks are short-lived, powerful sources of neutrinos
and magnetized jets. Such disks are plausible sources of gamma-ray bursts.
This review describes the disk structure, the neutrino conversion to
electron-positron plasma around the disk, and the post-burst evolution.
abstract



Introduction

Hyper-accretion disks form when a neutron star merges with another compact
object, neutron star or a black hole. Recent numerical simulations of
mergers are fully relativistic and show how
most of the mass of the binary system disappears behind the event horizon
in about 10~ms, leaving a rotating debris disk around the black hole.
The mass of this centrifugally supported disk is 0.01-0.1\,M_ ,
similar to what was found in previous non-relativistic simulations
(e.g. ). The ensuing disk accretion is not followed
by the merger simulations. It is established on a viscous timescale
0.1~s as the inner parts of the disk relax to a quasi-steady
state; this relaxation was studied numerically in .
Most but not all of the disk is accreted on the timescale
, releasing an energy comparable to c^2 and emitting copious
neutrinos. This disk has an accretion rate
( M_ /s)\;( /0.1\, M_ )\;( /0.1 ~s)^-1.

Similar neutrino-emitting disks may form during the core-collapse of
massive stars if the stellar material has a sufficient angular momentum
. These hypothetical objects are often called
``collapsars.'' After the formation of a central black hole of mass
M 3\,M_ collapsars develop an accretion disk that
is fed by the continually infalling stellar material.
The high accretion rate 0.1\,M_ ~s^-1 is sustained
for 10~s (the core-collapse timescale).
Recent relativistic MHD simulations of this accretion show
how the black hole could accumulate a large magnetic flux and create
jets via the Blandford-Znajek process .

The studies of hyper-accretion disks are greatly stimulated by observations
of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs, see for a review).
Hyper-accretion is expected to produce hyper-jets on a timescale
0.1-10~s. If a fraction _ jet of the accretion power
Mc^2 is channeled to a relativistic jet, it leads to an explosion
with energy E_ jet 2 10^51(M_ acc/ M_ )
( _ jet/10^-3)~erg,
where M_ acc is the mass accreted through the disk.
The energy and duration of the jet is consistent with GRB observations.

Hyper-accretion disks are markedly different from normal accretion
disks in X-ray binaries and AGN. Their optical depth to photon scattering
is enormous and radiation is trapped inside the disk, being advected by
the matter into the black hole.
However, the disk can be efficiently cooled by neutrino emission.
Significant neutrino losses can occur when M>10^-3\,M_ ~s^-1
and make the disk relatively thin and neutron rich.

The accreting black hole is expected to have a significant angular
momentum, because it forms from rotating matter and is further spun up by
accretion. The black-hole spin helps the jet formation through the
Blandford-Znajek process. It also affects the black-hole spacetime in
such a way that the disk extends to smaller radii and
the overall efficiency of accretion significantly increases.
For example, the inner radius of the disk
around a maximally-rotating black hole (spin parameter a=1)
is reduced by a factor of 6 compared with the Schwarzschild case a=0.
This leads to a higher temperature and a higher neutrino intensity
above the disk, increasing the rate of neutrino annihilation into e^
pairs.
Therefore, disks around rapidly spinning black holes can deposit an
interesting fraction of their energy into the e^ plasma outside the
disk and facilitate the formation of ultra-relativistic jets.

The size of a hyper-accretion disk depends on the specific angular momentum
of the accreting matter, l, which is modest in neutron-star mergers
and probably even smaller in collapsars.
The accretion flows in collapsars are quasi-spherical and
may form a special ``mini-disk'' that is not supported centrifugally and
instead accretes on the free-fall time.
Larger l leads to standard viscous accretion,
which leaves a relict disk carrying the initial angular momentum of the
accreted matter. The relict disk gradually spreads to larger radii, and
its late evolution may be relevant to the post-burst activity of GRBs.

Viscous disks

As matter spirals into the black hole, it is viscously heated:
the gravitational energy is converted to heat.
The heat is distributed between nuclear matter, radiation, and e^ pairs,
in perfect thermodynamic equilibrium.
In particular, the equilibrium e^ population is maintained.
As discussed below, electrons are mildly degenerate in neutrino-cooled
disks, which affects the e^ density.
The equilibrium microphysics is determined by only three parameters:
temperature T, baryon mass density , and electron fraction Y_e
(equal to the charged nucleon fraction). Other parameters ---
e.g. the electron chemical potential _e and density of e^ pairs,
n_ --- are derived from T, and Y_e.
At radii r 10^8~cm, temperature and density are high enough
to maintain the nuclear statistical equilibrium, which determines the
abundances of all nuclei. Nuclear matter in the disk is dissociated into
free nucleons n and p inside radius r_ =(40-100)r_g where
r_g 2GM/c^2. The temperature at this radius is kT 1~MeV.

Neutrino cooling is significant in the inner region where kT>1~MeV.
The far dominant mechanism of neutrino emission is the e^
capture onto nucleons:

e^-+p n+ _e, e^++n p+ _e.

The escaping neutrinos not only cool down the disk --- they also change
its electron fraction Y_e if the emission rates of and
are not exactly equal. The first goal of the disk modeling is to find T,
, Y_e, and self-consistently evaluate the neutrino losses.

Modeling disk accretion

Accretion is quasi-steady in the inner region of
the disk where is shorter than the timescale of evolution.
Viscosity in accretion disks is caused by MHD turbulence,
sustained by the magneto-rotational instability .
It creates an effective kinematic viscosity coefficient , which may
be related to the half-thickness of the disk, H, and sound speed, c_s:
~ = c_sH, where 0.01-0.1 is a dimensionless parameter.
A number of works studied hyper-accretion disks with this traditional
parameterization of viscosity .
Two works constructed models in full general relativity and studied
disks around spinning black holes .
The following list highlights advances and limitations of the
current models :

list-- 4mm 5mm
The model is fully relativistic: the disk dynamics is calculated in
Kerr metric.

Hydrodynamic equations are solved with the vertically-integrated
prescription. The equations include radial transport of heat and lepton number.


Local microphysics is calculated exactly: nuclear composition, electron
degeneracy, neutrino emissivity and opacity etc., using the equilibrium
distribution functions for all species except neutrinos. Neutrinos are
modeled separately in the opaque and transparent zones of the disk,
matching at the transition between the two zones.

The model provides only vertically averaged T, , and Y_e
(which are approximately equal to their values in the midplane of the disk).
The diffusion of neutrinos in the opaque zone is treated in the simplest
one-zone approximation (using escape probability).
This gives a good approximation for the energy losses, however, does
not give the exact neutrino spectrum emerging from the opaque zone.

list

The vertically-integrated approximation
provides no information about the vertical structure of the disk and
its corona. The vertical structure may be eventually understood with
global 3D time-dependent MHD simulations that include energy losses,
although the results of such simulations generally depend on the assumed
initial magnetic configuration. The behavior of magnetic field on large
scales is coupled to the local turbulence cascade that extends to scales
H. The microscopic magnetic Prandtl number for hyper-accretion
disks has been recently estimated in . The models discussed
here are aware of the MHD issues only through the value of . They
are computationally much cheaper than MHD simulations and allow one to
study the disk in a broad range of and .

Vertically-integrated disks are described by 1D equations that express
conservation of
baryon number, energy, and momentum (angular and radial) in Kerr spacetime
(see for a review). The full set of these equations can be solved
, and the solutions show that the deviation from circular Keplerian
rotation is small ( 10\
advective (i.e. when the released heat is transported radially without
losses).
A strong reduction of below _ K can occur in the
limit of a large steady disk with no cooling. This limit does not apply
to hyper-accretion disks which are transient and have a moderate radius.
Thus, the angular velocity of the disk can be approximated by its Keplerian
value . A small radial velocity is superimposed on this rotation:
u^r=- \,S^-1\,c_s\,(H/r), where c_s=(P/ )^1/2 is the
isothermal sound speed, H is the half-thickness of the disk; S(r) is
a numerical factor determined by the inner boundary condition .
This description of the velocity field in the disk is a good approximation
everywhere except in the very vicinity of the inner boundary where |u^r|
exceeds c_s.



In contrast to accretion disks in X-ray binaries and AGN, there is
one more conservation law that must be taken into account:
conservation of lepton number,


1H( N_ - N_ )
=u^r [ m_p dY_edr+ ddr
(n_ -n_ ) ].

Here N_ and N_ are the number fluxes of
neutrinos and anti-neutrinos per unit area (from one face of the disk),
n_ and n_ are the number densities of neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos inside the disk. This equation determines Y_e, which
is related to the neutron-to-proton ratio by Y_e=(n_n/n_p+1)^-1 and
greatly affects the rate of neutrino cooling.



In the models solved in and shown below, Y_e is calculated
using Eq.~(). Note, however, that throughout
most of the neutrino-cooled disk, the right side of
Eq.~() is small compared with each of the two terms on the
left side, and Y_e is nearly equal to the local equilibrium value such that
N_ N_ . This equilibrium Y_e is determined
by the local temperature and density and found for both neutrino-opaque and
neutrino-transparent matter . It is shown in Fig.~1.



Overview of disk properties

Hyper-accretion disks have several zones separated by the
following characteristic radii:

into free nucleons. The destruction of -particles consumes 7~MeV
per nucleon, which makes the disk thinner.

"Ignition" radius where neutrino emission switches on.
At this radius, the mean electron energy becomes comparable to
(m_n-m_p)c^2, enabling the capture reaction e^-+p n+ .
Then neutrino cooling due to reactions~() becomes
significant, further reducing the disk thickness H/r.

Radius r_ where the disk becomes opaque to neutrinos
and they relax to a thermal distribution. The disk is still
almost transparent to anti-neutrinos at this radius.

Radius r_ where the disk becomes opaque to anti-neutrinos,
so that both and are now in thermal equilibrium with
the matter. The disk is still cooled efficiently at this
radius since and diffuse and escape the flow faster
than it accretes into the black hole.

Radius where neutrino diffusion out of the disk becomes slower
than accretion, and neutrinos get trapped and advected into the black hole.

enumerate


The different zones of the disk are shown on the M-r diagram in
Fig.~2. In addition, this figure shows the zone of gravitational instability.

Three characteristic accretion rates can be defined:
above which the disk is neutrino-cooled in the inner region,
above which the disk is opaque to neutrinos in the inner region,
and above which the trapping of neutrinos occurs in the inner region.
The dependence of , , and on is well
approximated by the following power laws ,


= ( 0.1 )^5/3,
= ( 0.1 ),
= ( 0.1 )^1/3.

The normalization factors K depend on the black hole spin a.
For a=0.95 they are =0.021\,M_ ~s^-1,
=0.06\,M_ ~s^-1, =1.8\,M_ ~s^-1
and for a=0 they are
=0.071\,M_ ~s^-1, =0.7\,M_ ~s^-1,
=9.3\,M_ ~s^-1.



To complete this short guide to quasi-steady viscous disks, Figs.~3-4 show
T, , Y_e, and H/r for a model with
M=0.2\,M_ ~s^-1, M=3\,M_ , and a=0.95.

The main properties of the neutrino-cooled disk (i.e. at r< )
may be summarized as follows .

list 5mm

The disk is relatively thin, H/r 0.1-0.3,
especially in the inner region where most of accretion energy is released.

The -cooled disk is locally very close to -equilibrium,
N_ N_ . In particular, the relation between
, T, and Y_e calculated under the equilibrium assumption
(Fig.~1) is satisfied with a high accuracy.

Degeneracy of electrons in the disk significantly suppresses
the positron density n_e^+. However, the strong degeneracy limit is
not applicable --- the disk regulates itself to a mildly degenerate state
with _e/kT=1-3.
The reason of this regulation is the negative feedback of degeneracy on
the cooling rate: higher degeneracy _e/kT fewer
electrons (lower Y_e) and positrons (n_e^+/n_e^- e^- _e/kT)
weaker neutrino emission
lower cooling rate higher temperature lower
degeneracy.

Pressure in -cooled disks is dominated by baryons,
P P_b=( /m_p)kT, most of which are neutrons (Fig.~5 shows
contributions to pressure for two sample models).

All -cooled disks are very neutron rich in the inner region,
with Y_e 0.1 or lower.

Neutrino annihilation around the disk

The emitted neutrinos and anti-neutrinos can collide and convert to e^ ,
thereby depositing energy .
The emission of tau and muon neutrinos is negligible ,
so only reaction _e + _e e^-+e^+ can be considered.
Its cross section (assuming center-of-momentum energy m_ec^2)
is given by _ 3.3 10^-45
( p_ p_ )^2
(p_ ^0 p_ ^0)^-1cm^2
where p_ , p_ are the 4-momenta of _e
and _e, expressed in units of m_ec. The cross section is small
and only a small fraction 10^-3-10^-2 of the total
neutrino luminosity L converts to e^ plasma. Nevertheless, this
energy may be sufficient to drive a relativistic jet (or help the formation
of a magnetically-dominated jet) since it occurs above the disk where the
mass density is relatively low, especially near the rotation axis
.



Neutrinos emitted by the disk follow null geodesics in Kerr spacetime.
The efficiency of their annihilation can be calculated
numerically by tracing the geodesics, evaluating the local energy deposition
rate [erg~s^-1~cm^-3] everywhere around the black hole,
and then integrating over volume to obtain the net energy deposition rate
(energy at infinity per unit time at infinity).
The neutrino emission and annihilation is concentrated near the black hole,
where accretion is expected to be quasi-steady.
depends on four parameters that
specify the steady disk model: , , M, and a.



The energy deposition rate was estimated in ,
approximating geodesics by straight lines.
Fully relativistic calculations were made for several toy models,
in particular for disks or tori with uniform temperature or other
arbitrary distribution of temperature or entropy (see and
refs. therein).
Recently, the relativistic calculation for a realistic disk around a
spinning black hole has been done (Zalamea \& Beloborodov, in preparation).
has been obtained everywhere around the black hole,
including its ergosphere, and the dependence of
on , , M, and a has been determined.



Besides tracing the geodesics, this calculation involves a model for
neutrino and anti-neutrino spectra emitted by the disk.
Using the results of , it is straightforward to evaluate the
spectra from the transparent zone of the disk.
It is more difficult to find the spectrum that emerges from the
opaque zone, because the neutrino transport in this zone depends on the
unknown vertical distribution of viscous heating. Various assumptions
may be made about this distribution
,
including a strong heating of the magnetic corona above the disk.
Note that the corona of a hyper-accretion disk is always in thermodynamic
equilibrium, and its temperature T_c is determined by its thermal energy
density U_c=U_ +U_e 3a_rT_c^4 where
a_r=7.56 10^-15~erg~cm^-3~K^-4 is the radiation constant.
U_c is generally smaller than the energy density inside the disk.
Therefore, relocating the heating from the disk to its corona
cannot significantly increase the energies of emitted neutrinos.



Fortunately, a robust estimate can be obtained for in spite of
the uncertainty in the vertical structure of the disk.
It is easy to see that all detailed models of neutrino spectrum formation
must predict practically the same rate of annihilation
above a neutrino-cooled disk. For such a disk,
neutrinos carry away a fixed energy flux F^- F^+
where F^+ 3 ^2 S(r)/8 is the rate of viscous heating.
Therefore, transfer models that predict a higher average energy of emitted
neutrinos, , must also predict a lower number density of the neutrinos
above the disk, n F^-/ c ^-1.
Since the annihilation cross section _ ^2,
one finds that the reaction rate
n_ c _ n_ n_
is independent of . The energy deposition rate
n_ is proportional to .
It cannot be changed without a substantial change in temperature
(or electron chemical potential) of the neutrino source, which
would require a huge change in energy density and therefore is hardly possible.



Detailed calculations confirm that weakly depends on the details of
the vertical structure and , transfer in the disk.
Consider two extreme models for the opaque zone.
Model~A: Neutrinos _e and _e are emitted with
the same distributions as found inside the disk (same temperature T and
chemical potential _ ).
The distribution normalization is, however, reduced compared with the
thermal level inside the disk, so that the emerging emission carries away
the known energy fluxes F_ and F_ that are found in .
Model~B: Neutrinos are emitted with a thermal Fermi-Dirac spectrum
with chemical potential _ =0 and the effective surface temperature
. The effective temperature is defined by (7/8) ^4=F^-,
where F^-=F_ +F_ is the energy flux from one side of the disk
and =a_rc/4 is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The factor 7/8 is
determined by the difference between Plank and Fermi-Dirac distributions
and the fact that the disk emits only _e and _e ---
the emission of other neutrino species is negligible.

The temperature T inside an opaque disk exceeds by factor
T/ _ ^1/4 when the neutrino optical depth _ 1.
The neutrino chemical potential is modest and, approximately, T.
Hence, even the extreme Model~A gives a moderate enhancement of ,
by the factor T/ . Zalamea \& Beloborodov (in preparation)
calculated in both Models A and B. The results of numerical
calculations are shown in Fig.~6 and demonstrate that the difference
between the two models is indeed small.



It is instructive then to consider Model C: same as Model~B except
that F^-=F^+ is assumed at all radii.
The assumption is clearly incorrect outside the region <r< .
Nevertheless, this simplest model gives a good approximation to
in a broad range < < (Fig.~6).
The deviation of Model~B from Model~C at 2 is
caused by the overshooting of F^- above F^+, which happens just
inside of (see Fig.~7 and 16 in ). As hot matter
accretes into the neutrino-cooled region, its stored heat is quickly
emitted with F^-/F^+ reaching 2 at r /2. For
disks with /2 a few r_g, this leads to the enhancement of
by the factor 2^9/4 compared with Model~C that assumes
F^-=F^+.
Note that in Model~C is explicitly independent of .
However, the range of where Model~C is applicable depends on
(Eq.~).



The scaling of with is easy to evaluate analytically.
The effective surface temperature is related to F^- F^+ by
^4 F^- . The neutrino number density above the disk
is proportional to ^3 ^3/4. The annihilation cross-section
_ ^2 (assuming k >m_ec^2).
Hence the energy deposition rate ^9 ^9/4, and
one can write


= E_0(a) ( M_ ~s^-1 )^9/4,
< < .

The normalization factor E_0 depends on the black hole spin a and
must be calculated numerically. For example, a=0.95 gives
E_0 10^52~erg~s^-1, which implies the efficiency
= /L 0.05( / M_ ~s^-1)^5/4.
It is much larger than the corresponding
value for a non-rotating black hole, by two orders of magnitude.



The strong dependence of on a may be seen from the following rough
estimate. The neutrino luminosity L peaks at that is a few times
the inner radius of the disk, (a) --- the marginally stable orbit,
which is determined by a.
The luminosity depends on approximately as ^-1, and
at scales as (L/ ^2)^1/4 ^-3/4. The energy
deposition rate scales as ^9 and
scales as ^3 , which yields ^-15/4.
Then the reduction in by a factor of 3 (as a increases from 0 to
0.95) gives a factor of 60 in . This estimate neglects the fact that
the gravitational bending of neutrino trajectories is stronger for smaller
. Stronger bending implies a larger average angle between neutrinos
and leads to an additional enhancement of . Therefore, a steeper
dependence of on is found in numerical simulations.
A simple power law ^-4.7 is an excellent approximation
to the numerical results for 0<a<0.95 which corresponds to
r_g< <3r_g (Zalamea \& Beloborodov, in preparation).



Note that is defined as the total energy deposition rate
outside the event horizon (including the ergosphere). A significant
fraction of the created e^ plasma must fall into the black hole,
and only the remaining fraction of will add energy to the jet.
This fraction depends on the plasma dynamics outside the disk, which is
affected by magnetic fields and is hard to calculate without additional
assumptions.

Low-angular-momentum disks in collapsars

The quasi-spherical accretion flows in collapsars create a centrifugally
supported disk if the circularization radius of the flow is sufficiently
large, r_ circ 10r_g.
A smaller disk may not be centrifugally supported and then will accrete
on a free-fall timescale . It accretes so fast (super-sonically)
that the effects of viscosity can be neglected. A steady model of this
``mini-disk'' was constructed in and 2D time-dependent
hydrodynamical simulations were performed in .



The mini-disk can be thought of as a caustic in the equatorial plane of
a rotating accretion flow. It absorbs the feeding infall, and this
interaction releases energy, making the accretion radiatively efficient.
With increasing angular momentum, the size of the disk grows up to 14r_gc,
at which point the centrifugal barrier stops accretion, so that it
can proceed only on a viscous timescale. Thus, the mini-disk model fills
the gap between two classical regimes of accretion
--- spherical (l<r_gc) and standard accretion disk (l r_gc)
--- and is qualitatively different from both.



The calculations of were limited to the case of a Schwarzschild
black hole. Recently, the model has been extended to the case of
a Kerr black hole (Zalamea \& Beloborodov, in preparation).
Fig.~7 shows the range of angular momenta that lead to mini-disk
formation around a black hole of spin 0<a<1. The critical angular momentum
for viscous disk formation sets the maximum radius of a mini-disk. This
radius is 14r_g=28GM/c^2 for a=0 and 5r_g for a=0.95.



The mini-disk is sandwiched by shocks through which the
infalling matter enters the disk. The model of assumes that
the cooling timescale of the postshock material is sufficiently short,
shorter than the accretion timescale in the disk.
Let us check if this assumption can be valid for collapsars.
The postshock mass density and energy density can be estimated as

10^9 M_3^-2 ( rr_g )^-3/2
~g~cm^-3,
U 0.2 c^2 ( rr_g )^-1.

Here 2 is the compression in the shock (note that the shock
dissipates only the normal component of the infall velocity);
_0.1 /0.1\, M_ ~s^-1 and M_3 M/3\, M_ .
The postshock matter has _e/kT<1, and U is dominated
by radiation and e^ pairs, which implies U 3a_rT^4.
The postshock temperature is then
T 5.3 10^10\, _9^1/4(r/r_g)^-1/4~K.
Disintegration of nuclei in the shock consumes only 10^-2 of the
energy released at r r_g, so the postshock matter can be cooled only
by neutrino emission. Neutrino emission is dominated by two processes:
(i) capture reactions~() provide cooling rate
q_c 9 10^32T_11^6 _9~erg~cm^-3~s^-1, and
(ii) e^ annihilation e^++e^- + provides
q_ 3.6 10^33T_11^9~erg~cm^-3~s^-1
(see e.g. ). This gives

q_c 2 10^31 _9^5/2
( rr_g )^-3/2 \; erg cm^3 ~s,

q_ 10^31 _9^9/4
( rr_g )^-9/4 \; erg cm^3 ~s,

Approximating the total q= q_c+ q_ q_c,
one finds

q\; U 10^-2 _9^3/2 ( rr_g )M_3
10^-2 ^3/2 ^3/2 ( rr_g )^-5/4M_3^-2,

where 10^-4(r/r_g)^-3/2M_3~s. The mini-disk is
neutrino-cooled if q\; /U 1, which requires a high
accretion rate, comparable to M_ ~s^-1. Thus, only high-
mini-disks are sandwiched by radiative shocks that stay near the equatorial
plane in the innermost region of the accretion flow. A large neutrino
luminosity, up to 0.1 c^2, is produced by such disks.



For smaller accretion rates, the postshock matter is unable to cool on the
free-fall timescale, and the neutrino luminosity from the inner region is
suppressed by the factor q /U < 1.
Then a hot low-angular-momentum bubble must grow around the black hole.
Mass flows into the bubble through the shock front that expands to
r r_g. Such a bubble is observed in low- simulations in .
It resembles the bubble around viscous disks in the models of
, except for a slower rotation, less centrifugal
support, and faster accretion. The shock expansion can be stopped when it
approaches 40r_g=4 10^7M_3~cm. Up to this radius, the
postshock temperature, T 7 10^9 ^1/4(r/40r_g)^-5/8~K,
is high enough to disintegrate nuclei at the density
4 10^6 (r/40r_g)^-3/2~g~cm^-3.
As the shock expands to 40r_g, its energy decreases to
GMm_p/r 12(r/40r_g)^-1~MeV per nucleon, and a large fraction of
this energy is consumed by disintegration (8~MeV per nucleon);
therefore, the shock stalls.

Spreading of viscous disks and nuclear burning

Formation of a viscous disk with r_ circ>10 r_g implies that most of
the angular momentum of accreting matter will be stored outside the black
hole, in a viscously spreading ring. When matter supply to the disk stops,
accretion will proceed from this ring.
At any time t, the characteristic size of the ring R(t) is where its
mass peaks. Alternatively, R can be defined by =(GMR)^1/2 ,
where is the angular momentum carried by the disk and m is its mass.

Spreading of merger disks

Immediately after the merger, the characteristic size of the debris disk
is R_0 10^7~cm, and its initial mass m_0 may be as large as
0.1\,M_ .
The mass of the debris disk is sensitive to the parameters of the binary
system before the merger, in particular to the mass ratio and the spins
of the two companions, see e.g. for a review.
Its viscous evolution starts on a timescale
t_0=( )^-1(H/r)^-2 0.1( /0.1)^-1~s, with
accretion rate _0 m_0/t_0 that can exceed 1\,M_ ~s^-1.
The disk is initially hot and -opaque (cf. Fig.~2);
its nuclear matter is composed of free nucleons n and p.



The initial accretion phase lasts t_0. Following this stage, the disk
mass m(t) is reduced and its radius R(t) grows to conserve the angular
momentum, J=m(GMR)^1/2 const, which implies m R^-1/2.
Several important changes occur in the disk as it spreads to
R 10^2r_g 10^8~cm:

list 5mm

Temperature T and electron chemical potential _e in the outer
region r R decrease to 1~MeV. As a result, the disk material at
r R is not -cooled anymore: R(t) exits the neutrino-cooled
region r< on the -r diagram (Fig.~2). The viscously produced
heat outside is stored and advected by the spreading accretion disk.
The spreading matter is then marginally bound to the black hole,
c_s .

Electrons become non-degenerated. Pressure is not dominated
by neutrons anymore: it is dominated by radiation and e^ pairs,
P P_ +P_ a_rT^4.

Y_e freezes.

Nuclear burning occurs: free nucleons n and p recombine into
particles. This process releases energy of 7~MeV per nucleon,
comparable to the binding energy GMm_p/r, and unbinds most of the disk
matter, ejecting it in a freely expanding wind.
In addition to nuclear burning and viscous heating, the matter is heated
by neutrinos emitted at r r_g (the mass accretion rate by the black
hole is still significant when R(t) approaches 10^8~cm). The energy
deposited by neutrinos in the advective zone of the spreading disk,
r 50r_g is comparable to the viscously dissipated energy in
this zone.

All these changes happen as R(t) grows from 50 to 100r_g.



A one-zone model of the spreading disk is calculated in a recent work
. Let us estimate here one characteristic radius
at which = . Here is the time of conversion
n p through reactions~() .
At~ , pressure is already becoming dominated by radiation and
non-degenerate e^ pairs. On the other hand, n and p have not yet
recombined. The timescales and are then given by

Using the hydrostatic balance P/ =(H/r)^2 ^2 with

_ekT 1.0\;Y_e\,h^-7/4M_3^-3/4m_32^1/4,

where h 2H/R, M_3 M/3\,M_ ,
m_32 m/10^32 ~g=(m/0.05\,M_ ), and R_8 R/10^8cm.
(Note that _e/kT depends on m and h only, not R.) This gives

m_32^-3/28 ~MeV,

At this temperature and density matter is close to the neutronization line

Hence the equilibrium value of Y_e at is Y_e^ 0.5.
The actual Y_e in the spreading disk gradually freezes out as R(t) passes
through and its asymptotic value after the transition can differ from
Y_e^ . The freeze-out Y_e 0.3 is found in
using a dynamical model for the spreading disk.
Note that the model describes the average value of Y_e.
Viscous spreading is a random diffusion process, so different elements of
the disk spend different times near , and a longer residence time
at gives a higher Y_e. One can therefore expect a mixture of
different Y_e in the spreading disk, with a dispersion
Y_e/Y_e 1 around the average value.



Soon after passing this mixture is heated by nuclear recombination
and ejected in a wind of duration (R=10^8 ~cm).
Subsequent nucleosynthesis in the expanding ejecta produces diverse
radio-active elements, including some with a long life-time.
Their decay can make the ejecta visible to a distant observer .
In particular, material with Y_e 0.5 will synthesize ^56Ni.
^56Ni decays when the ejecta expand so much that their thermal radiation
can diffuse out and escape to observer, producing an optical flash similar
to normal supernovae.

Spreading of collapsar disks

The collapsar disks are continually fed by the
infalling stellar matter during a long time 10~s (and longer,
with a decreasing infall rate). The model posits that the angular momentum
of the infall, , is sufficiently large to form a viscous disk
, e.g., the circularization radius of the infall in
the numerical model of is 30r_g. The accretion
timescale at this radius, 3 10^-2 _0.1^-1s
is much shorter than .
This led and many subsequent works to picture a low-mass
disk, 3 10^-3 that is continually
drained into the black hole and re-filled with fresh infalling matter.



The picture of a low-mass viscous disk is, however, implausible.
Conservation of angular momentum requires the following:
(1) The disk spreads during to a radius
R 3 10^2r_g( /0.1)^-1
where the viscous timescale is comparable to .
(2) The disk accumulates mass m that
carries angular momentum J= - . Here = is
the total angular momentum processed by the collapsar disk,
r_gc is the angular momentum accreted by the black hole,
and M_ is the mass accreted through the disk.
Since > for any viscous disk and usually ,
such disks must store (unless almost all angular momentum
is carried away by a wind). This implies that the disk accumulates
the mass,

m (R) = ( R )^1/2
M_ .

The disk mass may be much smaller than this estimate only if is
so small that , which leaves J for the disk.
This condition leads, however, to the inviscid mini-disk described in
the previous section. A low-mass viscous disk could form only if
is fine-tuned toward the boundary between the viscous and mini-disk
accretion regimes (cf. Fig.~7).
The very small m 0.003\,M_ found in the simulations of
may be the result of the imposed absorbing boundary
condition at r_ in=50 ~km 5r_g, which is 5
times larger than the true inner radius of the disk, r_g.
The large r_ in implies an artificially large , which
happens to be nearly equal to in the model, permitting J .
In addition, a (small) fraction of is carried away by the wind.



Spreading of viscous disks in collapsars through a radius 10^2r_g is
accompanied by significant changes, similar to the evolution of merger disks
described above. In particular, matter acquires a positive Bernoulli constant
as a result of viscous, nuclear, and neutrino heating. The infalling material
of the progenitor star exerts an external ram pressure on the disk, and
can confine the disk initially, but eventually the disk pressure must win
and its matter will expand with a velocity 2 10^9~cm/s.
The ejected mass 10^33~g carries the energy E 10^52~erg
and will explode the outer parts of the star. To a first approximation,
the expansion of the outer disk may be described as a thermal explosion
driven mainly by nuclear burning of n and p into particles.
A fraction of the unbound disk matter will turn into ^56Ni and should
create a bright supernovae-like event.

Self-similar spreading at late stages

The disk matter that has spread beyond 10^8~cm is largely unbound
and ejected, however, some matter remains bound and rotating in a remnant
disk. Its mass is hard to estimate; it could be as large as
0.1\,M_ for collapsars and 0.01\,M_ for mergers.
This remnant is composed of recombined nucleons, and further fusion
reactions are not a significant source of energy (compared with
the virial/gravitational energy). The central source of neutrinos switches
off as drops, so neutrino heating is also insignificant.
This advective remnant disk will continue to spread viscously to larger
radii, gradually draining its mass into the black hole and possibly
losing mass to a wind.



If the mass loss through a wind is small, the spreading enters a simple
self-similar regime such that =const, R(t) grows as a power-law
with time, while (t) and m(t) decrease as power-laws with time.
Detailed self-similar models of this type were studied, see e.g.
. The advective disk has a scale-height H r,
sound speed c_s =(GM/r)^1/2, and . Its kinematic
viscosity coefficient is c_s H r= ,
where (r)=(GMr)^1/2. The disk spreading is a diffusion process
described by

R^2(t) (R) t (GMR)^1/2t \;
R(t) ^2/3(GM)^1/3 t^2/3
R_0 ( tt_0 )^2/3,

where subscipt ``0'' refers to an initial reference moment of time t_0.
The disk mass m(t) is then found from the condition
=(GMR)^1/2m=const,

m(t)= (GMR)^1/2
m_0 ( RR_0 )^-1/2
m_0 ( tt_0 )^-1/3,

and the accretion rate is given by

(t) mt _0 ( tt_0 )^-4/3.




This self-similar solution may not apply if the disk loses mass through a
wind and consider solutions that include the wind.
In general, advective disks are only marginally bound by the gravitational
field of the black hole and their Bernoulli constant can be positive
. This is expected to cause a strong wind.
On the other hand, bound solutions with a negative Bernoulli constant were
found for spreading advective disks . The mass loss through
a wind then depends on the poorly understood vertical distribution of viscous
heating inside the disk and the behavior of the magnetic field above the disk.


Conclusions

Hyper-accretion disks are formed from matter with a modest angular momentum,
with circularization radius r_ circ well inside
10^2 r_g 10^8~cm. Matter with r_ circ 10r_g is
supported by the centrifugal barrier, and its accretion is driven by
viscous stresses on a timescale t_0 0.1( /0.1)^-1~s, where
0.01-0.1 is the viscosity parameter.
These viscous disks are dense and hot, and emit copious
neutrinos as long as the accretion rate exceeds
0.03( /0.1)^5/3\,M_ ~s^-1.



Neutrino annihilation above the disk deposits a significant energy that can
power GRB explosions. In contrast to previous expectations, the rate of
energy deposition is found to be not sensitive to the details
of neutrino transport and the vertical structure of the accretion disk.
It is given by E_0( / M_ ~s^-1)^9/4
in a broad range of accretion rates
(eq.~). The normalization factor E_0 is very sensitive to
the black hole spin a. For instance, E_0 10^52~erg~s^-1
is found for a black hole with a=0.95, which is two orders of magnitude
larger than E_0 for the Schwarzschild case a=0.



Remarkably, all neutrino-cooled viscous disks regulate themselves to a
characteristic state such that electrons are mildly degenerate,
Y_e 0.1, and free neutrons dominate the pressure in the disk .
The neutron-rich matter may contaminate the jet from the accreting black hole
and get ejected with a high Lorentz factor. Then the gradual decay of
the ejected neutrons affects the global picture of GRB explosion on scales
up to 10^17~cm, where the GRB blast wave is observed
.



The disk size R grows with time as a result of viscous spreading.
Most of the disk mass m(t) resides near R(t) and its state is not
described by the steady model (which remains valid at radii r<R).
Instead, it is described by a markedly different spreading solution.
In particular, as the disk spreads to 100r_g it is heated both
viscously and by the nuclear burning of free nucleons into helium.
In contrast, when matter accretes through 10^2r_g
(as in the steady-state model), this process is reversed:
helium is disintegrated, which leads to cooling.
As a result, the disk is disrupted before it spreads much beyond 10^8~cm:
the heated flow acquires a positive Bernoulli constant and gets unbound.



Then most of the disk mass m is ejected with a velocity
0.1~c and a total energy 10^52(m/ M_ )~erg.
A fraction of the ejected matter acquires Y_e 0.5, which favors
the synthesis of ^56Ni as the ejecta expand and their temperature drops.
The ensuing gradual decay of ^56Ni should produce a visible optical
flash on a week timescale --- a supernova-like event. The flash is expected
to be especially bright for collapsars that develop massive spreading
accretion disks. A similar (but weaker) flash should be
produced by the spreading disks around a merged binary; the ejected mass can
be a few orders of magnitude smaller in this case.



^56Ni-rich matter may also be ejected from the inner,
geometrically thin, neutrino-cooled disk. This can occur
if the inner disk produces a strong wind .
Such winds are modeled as quasi-steady magnetized outflows,
illuminated by neutrinos which can heat and de-neutronize the wind material.
The details of this plausible mechanism are uncertain because
the mass outflow rate and the asymptotic Y_e in the wind is hard to
predict with confidence --- both depend on the assumed
MHD behavior of the disk and its corona.



Following the main burst, the accretion rate is determined by the amount
of matter that remains bound and rotating around the black hole.
In collapsars, the fallback of the progenitor envelope is often assumed
to determine at late times. This assumption is invalid if a
viscous disk has formed. The disk stores and then ejects so much mass
and energy that it must explode the star. Even if the disk ejected
little mass/energy, the accretion of the envelope would be negligible
--- the relict disk would supply a larger accretion rate
t^-4/3.
(t) decreases steeply when the disk spreads beyond 10^8~cm and most
of its matter is ejected, however, some matter remains bound and continues
to accrete. The evolution of may be related to the observed puzzling
features in the afterglow emission of GRBs. The afterglow is likely to be
produced by the relativistic blast wave driven by the jet from the central
engine. Its luminosity is determined by the energy and magnetization of the
jet as well as the density profile of the ambient medium at
r 10^15-10^17~cm. A long-lived jet of luminosity
L_ jet= _ jet c^2
would certainly impact the afterglow emission.
However, current theories are unable to reliably predict the evolution
of and _ jet. For instance, one could speculate
that the jet switches off abruptly as decreases below a threshold,
which causes the observed steep decay in the afterglow light curves.



While the mechanism of the relativistic jet and its evolution with (t)
remain uncertain, the non-relativistic massive ejecta with v 0.1c
is a robust consequence of viscous-disk accretion. Viscous disks certainly
form in merger events. The standard collapsar model also assumes the
formation of a viscous disk, but this case is less certain. The minimum
angular momentum needed to form a disk is r_gc, and collapsars were
proposed as rare events of stellar collapse with l>r_g c. Hence,
statistically, the accretion flows in collapsars are likely to have small
l and their disks can be smaller than 10r_g. Such mini-disks
are not centrifugally supported and accrete faster than viscous disks.
In contrast to the viscous regime, this low-angular momentum accretion
leaves no remnant disk in the end of the core collapse, involves no
viscous spreading, and may not eject much mass. However, it still can
produce a powerful relativistic jet via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism
and/or neutrino heating near the rotation axis.
