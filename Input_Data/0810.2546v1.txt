abstract
We present results from the first extensive study of convection zones in the envelopes of hot massive stars, which are caused by opacity peaks
associated with iron and helium ionization. These convective regions can be located very close to the stellar surface.
The region in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in which we predict the convection zones and the strength of this convection is in good agreement
with the occurrence and strength of microturbulence in massive stars. We argue further that convection close to the surface may trigger clumping
at the base of the stellar wind of hot massive stars.

abstract


Introduction
With the introduction
of the so called iron peak in stellar opacities (Iglesias et al. 1992) a convection
zone appears in the envelope of sufficiently luminous massive main sequence models
(Stothers \& Chin 1993). This convective region contains little mass and is usually not discussed
in the context of stellar evolution calculations.
Here, we mainly focus on the question whether the occurrence of sub-surface convection might be
correlated with observable small scale velocity fields at the stellar surface and in the stellar wind.
A similar idea has been used to explain microturbulence in low mass stars (Edmunds 1978), in which
envelope convection zones are extended and reach the stellar photosphere.
While Edmunds (1978) concludes that the
same mechanism can not explain microturbulent velocities in O and B stars,
the iron-peak induced sub-photospheric convection zones in these stars were not yet
discovered at that time.
In fact, we demonstrate below that sub-surface convection may not only
cause photoshperic velocity fields which are observable, but possibly even induce clumping at the base of the stellar wind.
Method
We performed a systematic study of sub-surface convection by calculating models of hot stars with a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code (see for example Yoon et al. 2006).
The Ledoux criterion is used to determine which regions of the star are unstable to convection,
and the convective velocity is calculated according to the Mixing Length Theory (B\"ohm-Vitense 1958).
The opacities in our code are extracted from the OPAL tables (Iglesias \& Rogers 1996).
We calculated a grid of non-rotating stellar evolutionary models for initial masses
between 5 and 100 , at metallicities of Z=0.02, Z=0.008 and Z=0.004, roughly corresponding to
the Galaxy, the LMC and the SMC, respectively.
Sub-surface convective regions
The iron convective region in the envelope of hot stars corresponds to a peak in the
opacity at 5.3. The appearance and properties of this subsurface convective zone
have been studied. In particular we used our grid of models to map on the HR diagram the average convective velocity
in the upper part of the iron convection zone . Our main findings are:
itemize
For given luminosity and metallicity, increases with decreasing surface temperature.
The convection zones are located deeper inside the star (in radius, not in mass),
and the resulting larger pressure scale height leads to larger velocities.
At solar metallicity and 10^5 (i.e. roughly at 20 ) the velocities
increase from less then 1 at the ZAMS to more than 5 in the supergiant regime,
where = 2.5 is achieved at T_ eff 30\, 000\,K.
At SMC metallicity, the iron convection zone
is absent at the ZAMS for L < 10^5 , and a level of = 2.5 is only reached
at T_ eff 20\, 000\,K.
For given effective temperature and metallicity, the iron zone convective velocity
increases with increasing luminosity, as a larger flux demanded to be convectively transported
requires faster convective motions.
We found threshold luminosities below which iron convection zones do not occur, i.e.,
below about 10^3.2 , 10^3.9 , and 10^4.2 for the Galaxy, LMC and SMC, respectively.
The iron convection zones become weaker for smaller metallicities,
since due to the lower opacity, more of the flux can be transported by radiation.
The threshold luminosity for the occurrence of the iron convection zone
quoted above for Z=0.02 is ten times lower than that
for Z=0.004. And above the threshold, for a given point in the HR diagram, the convective velocities
are always larger for larger metallicity.

sketch_starsection_nosSchematic representation of the physical processes
connected to subsurface convection. Acoustic and gravity waves emitted in the convective zone
travel through the radiative layer and reach the surface, inducing density and velocity fluctuations.
In this picture microturbulence and clumping at the base of the wind are a
consequence of the presence of subsurface convection.sketchtclip,angle=0,width=115mm
Microturbulence
The microturbulent velocity is the non-thermal component of the photospheric velocity field which has a correlation length smaller than
the size of the line forming region. The non-thermal velocity component with a larger correlation length is referred to as macroturbulence (e.g. Aerts et al., this volume).
In fact the convective cells in the upper part of a convection zone act as pistons and generate
acoustic and gravity waves propagating outward. The problem of sound waves generated by turbulent motions has been
discussed by Lighthill (1952) and extended to a stratified atmosphere by Stein (1967) and Goldreich \& Kumar (1990). In the presence of stratification, gravity acts as a restoring force and allows the excitation of gravity waves as well. For both, acoustic and gravity waves, the most important parameter determining the emitted kinetic energy flux is the velocity of the convective motions. This is the reason why we used as the crucial parameter determining the efficiency of subsurface convection.
Lighthill (1952) and Stein (1967) showed that convection excites acoustic and gravity waves, with a maximum emission for waves with , the pressure scale height at the top of the convective region. They calculated the amount of convective flux F_c that is going into acoustic waves, F_ac F_c M_c^5 , and gravity waves, F_ g F_c M_c, where we take F_c _c ^3 and M_c is the Mach number for convection calculated at the top of the convective region.
Since convection in our models is highly subsonic, gravity waves are expected to extract more energy than acoustic waves from the convective region.
These waves can propagate outward, steepen and become dissipative in the region of line formation.
Here, they may induce density and velocity fluctuations (Fig.). The energy associated with the induced velocity fluctuations must be comparable or smaller than the energy in the waves
above the convective zone. For microturbulence to be excited by this process, it is required that E_ g E_ or

E_ gE_ M_c ( _c _s ) ( )^2 1 ,

where E_ _s ^2 is the energy associated with the microturbulent velocity field, _c is the density at the top of the convective region, _s is the surface density and is the microturbulent velocity.
We evaluated the ratio () using the data calculated from our models and a value for the microturbulent
velocity of 10 .
This value has been chosen according to a set of microturbulent velocity determinations in massive stars by Trundle et al. (2007) and Hunter et al. (2008), which has been obtained in the context of the ESO FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars (Evans et al. 2005), and has been analyzed in a coherent way. This provides a relatively large data base, even after restricting the data set to slow rotators, i.e. < 80 .
The error in the microturbulent velocity measurements is about 5 , which justifies our choice of = 10 in the evaluation of the ratio ().
Fig.~, shows that the process of excitation of microturbulence through sub-surface convection is energetically possible. Moreover, the region where sub-surface convection is efficiently generating gravity waves
corresponds very well with the location of stars in which a microturbulent velocity field is clearly present.
Using our grid of stellar models and the microturbulent velocity dataset of Trundle et al. (2007) and Hunter et al. (2008), these results have been confirmed
also for stars in the SMC and the Galaxy.

in the determination of is typically 5 . grwplottclip,angle=0,width=115mm
Clumping at the base of the stellar wind
Evidence has been accumulating that the winds of massive stars are
inhomogeneous on different spatial scales.
Indeed, evidence that O star winds are clumped is given by, among others,
Puls et al. (2006). These authors investigate the clumping
behavior of the inner wind (inside about two stellar radii) relative
to the clumping in the outer wind (beyond tens of stellar radii)
of a large sample of supergiant and giant stars.
They find that in stars that have strong winds, the inner
wind is more strongly clumped than the outer wind, whereas those
having weak winds have similar clumping properties in the inner and
outer regions. The analysis only allows for such a relative statement.
Interestingly, this type of radial behaviour is not consistent with
hydrodynamic predictions of the intrinsic, self-excited
line-driven instability (Runacres \& Owocki 2002,2005).
Such models predict a lower clumping in the
inner wind than in the outer wind.
If we compare the O stars investigated by Puls et al. (2006) with our models,
the trend is such that stars with relatively strong clumping in the inner winds are in a regime where
the subsurface convective velocity is larger. A correlation between clumping
at the base of the wind and may point to sub-photospheric
convection as a possible excitation mechanism of clumping at the base
of the wind.
If mass loss is affected by this clumping, the subsurface convective region in massive stars may impact stellar evolution.
