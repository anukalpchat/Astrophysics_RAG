abstract
We review attempts to estimate the influence of global cosmological
expansion on local systems. Here `local' is taken to mean that
the sizes of the considered systems are much smaller than cosmologically
relevant scales. For example, such influences can affect orbital
motions as well as configurations of compact objects, like
black holes. We also discuss how measurements based on the exchange of
electromagnetic signals of distances, velocities, etc. of moving
objects are influenced. As an application we compare orders of
magnitudes of such effects with the scale set by the apparently
anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts,
which is 10^-9 m/s^2. We find no reason to believe that
the latter is of cosmological origin. However, the general problem
of gaining a qualitative and quantitative understanding of how
the cosmological dynamics influences local systems remains
challenging, with only partial clues being so far provided by
exact solutions to the field equations of General Relativity.

Introduction

There is by now ample evidence that our Universe is expanding on average.
This means that on the largest scales one observes redshifts from
structures that are interpreted as recessional motion, also called the
Hubble flow. To first approximation, the relative velocity between two
structures grows linearly with their mutual distance. The constant of
proportionality is the so-called Hubble constant, H_0, whose value is
now fairly accurately measured as being close to
70\,Km s^-1 Mpc^-1, see e.g.~.
This means that for any additional mega-parsec
(Mpc=3.262 10^6\,lightyears=
3.086 10^19\,km) the recessional velocity picks up an
extra 70 kilometers per second. Clearly, typical peculiar velocities
superimpose on the global Hubble flow. For galaxies they can be up to
1000 kilometers per second, so that the Hubble flow definitely dominates
at distances above 200\,Mpc, i.e.~above supercluster scale. In
this respect it is remarkable that Hubble's classic paper
of 1929 plots the velocity-distance relation of extra-galactic nebulae only
up to 2\,Mpc, though it has to be added that in those days
distances where generally underestimated, sometimes up to a factor of 10.

For pedagogical purposes the global expansion is sometimes represented
by the two-dimensional balloon model, in which three-dimensional space
corresponds to the two-dimensional surface of an inflating rubber balloon;
see e.g.~ \,27.5 in .
At each point attached to the rubber material an observer sees other points
attached in a state of radial recessional motion, the faster the further
they are away. This picture is used to stress that each point is locally
(i.e.~with respect to the local rubber material) at rest but receding from
all other points because space in-between is itself expanding. However, this
global expansion does not affect all structures: Local overdensities in the
matter distribution may inhibit space from expanding. In the balloon model
of this is represented by little
pennies being glued onto the balloon. The rubber material underneath the
coins does not expand due to the stiff glue which holds it in place. The
question arises what, in reality, are the structures corresponding to the
coin and what dynamical mechanism provides the glue? It is often heard that
`bound systems' do not participate in the global expansion, or that
systems below the scale of galaxy clusters `break away' from the Hubble
flow. But what does `bound' and `break away' really mean?
For a recent discussion on the meaning of `joining the
Hubble flow' see~.
For example, is it obvious that the Astronomical Unit is not affected by
global expansion (compare )
or can it even be, as e.g.~suggested in , that our
Universe is contracting on small scales while it expands in the large?
If so, what precisely would rule the relation between contracting and
expanding scales?

The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss attempts that aim to
make precise and answer some of these fundamental questions, taking due
account of the dynamical laws and the kinematical framework of General
Relativity. We will emphasize the changes in kinematical relations within
time-dependent spacetime geometries, which seem to be widely neglected
in related discussions.

Next to being a question of fundamental interest, the raised issue also needs
to be clarified quantitatively in connection with more practical aims, like,
e.g., the modeling of celestial reference frames~.
The specific question of whether the global expansion has any influence on
the local dynamics and kinematics within the Solar System has recently also
attracted increasing attention in connection with the so-called
`Pioneer-Anomaly'~,
henceforth abbreviated by PA. Here frequency-measurements in Doppler tracking
are translated into standard kinematical quantities, like velocity and
acceleration. The result shows an anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer
satellites directed towards the center of the Solar System.
In the magnitude of this acceleration is reported to
be a=8.6 1.34 10^-10\,m s^-2. Note that such
an apparently small acceleration amounts to variations in spatial
localization of nearly 500 kilometers after 10 years. It so happens that the
magnitude of this acceleration is very close to the product of the current
value of the Hubble constant, H_0, and the velocity of light in vacuum:

split
H_0c&
(70\,km s^-1 Mpc^-1 )
(3 10^5\,km s^-1 )
&=7 10^-10\,m s^-2\,.
split

Whether this `almost coincidence' of numbers does indeed have any deeper
significance can and should only be decided on the basis of reliable
estimates within the dynamical framework of General Relativity. There already
exist various speculations and claims in the literature that try to attribute
the PA to either simple kinematical (e.g.~)
or dynamical (e.g.~) effects of a time varying
background geometry, though none of them does justice to the requirements
posed by General Relativity.
The reader will soon find out that we disagree with all such
claims.
This is clearly a very difficult task: There is very little analytical
knowledge of how to model in terms of exact solutions, or at least in terms
of controlled approximations to exact solutions, the hierarchy of mutually
embedded systems:
Solar System Galaxy Local Group
Cluster Supercluster Standard-Cosmological
Solution. Usually we expect each such system to define a typical length
scale beyond which we may consider it as quasi isolated~.
But, clearly, whether this is a valid assumption or not can only be
decided on the basis of a self-consistent dynamical consideration.
In our context all this suggests to first study the influence
of cosmic expansion on the most simple systems immersed in an
otherwise homogeneous cosmological background. We will see that
this already poses a number of non-trivial analytical as well as
conceptual problems.

In this article we will derive upper bounds for various effects of global
expansion on local systems in the context of such simple models. The idea
here is that the upper bounds so derived will a fortiori be upper
bounds in more realistic models, since a further embedding of the system
we consider into a higher structure of local overdensities will further
suppress the influence of cosmological expansion. This is evidently true
in situations in which the spherically symmetric Einstein--Straus model
applies, but can also be argued for as a result of taking into account
small-scale anisotropies in the matter distribution, as has been done
from first-order perturbations of the Newtonian
equations~. We conclude form this that if we
find the relevant upper bounds to be outside current experimental reach,
this will maintain to be the case in more realistic contexts.

Strategic outline and results

Improved Newtonian equations

The strategies that so far have been followed are twofold: Either one
studies modified Newtonian or special relativistic equations of
motions for two point-particles with a force of mutual attraction
(gravitational or electromagnetic). The modifications are derived from
putting the system into a fixed standard-cosmological background (usually
spatially flat) without back-reactions being taken into account. We shall
discuss this approach in Sections and
. Our discussion, based on ,
complements the perturbative analysis in which
misses all orbits which are unstable under cosmological expansion (which do
exist). In this respect we follow a very similar strategy as, e.g., in the
more recent papers by~ (the basic idea of which goes back at
least to~) and also~,
though we think that there are also useful differences. We also supply
quantitative estimates and clarify that the improved Newtonian equations
of motion are written in terms of the right coordinates (non-rotating and
metrically normalized). The purpose of this model is to develop a good
physical intuition for the qualitative as well as quantitative features
of any dynamical effects involved.

Eventually the Newtonian model just mentioned has to be understood as a
limiting case of a genuinely relativistic treatment. For the gravitational
case this is done in Section~ (an alternative and more
geometric derivation is given in Section~), where
we employ the McVittie metric to model a spherically symmetric mass embedded
in a spatially flat Friedmann-- --Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe.
The geodesic equation is then, in a suitable limit, shown to lead to the
improved Newtonian model discussed above (see also
). The same holds for the electromagnetic case,
as we show in Section~.
There we take a slight detour to also reconsider a classic argument by
Dicke \& Peebles~, which allegedly shows the
absence of any relevant dynamical effect of global expansion. Its original
form only involved the dynamical action principle together with some simple
scaling argument. Since this reference is one of the most frequently cited
in this field, and since the simplicity of the argument (which hardly
involves any real analysis) is definitely deceptive, we give an independent
treatment that makes no use of any hypothetical scaling rules for physical
quantities other than spatial lengths and times. Our treatment, which
follows , also reveals that the original argument
by Dicke \& Peebles is insufficient to discuss leading order effects of
cosmological expansion. It is therefore also ineffective in its attempt
to contradict~.

Exact solutions

The other approach consists of finding exact solutions to Einstein's field
equations for an inhomogeneous situation that, in the most simple case,
models a single, quasi-localized, non-rotating, electrically neutral
inhomogeneity within a FLRW universe. Using this inhomogeneous solution as
background one can then study the motion of test particles (following
geodesics in the background geometry) and, in particular, the influence of
expansion on this motion.

This approach can be subdivided into two strategies. The first tries
to literally construct a new exact solution out of two known ones, so
that the new solution contains a connected piece from each of the two
old ones as isometric submanifolds. These we refer to as
matched solutions. This is relaxed in the second, more
general strategy, where the new solution is merely required to
somehow approximate the relevant part of each of the two old
solutions in some region. These we refer to as melted solutions.
Needless to say that melted solutions offer a much greater
variety for construction than matched ones. However, it is
also true that often not much is known about the proper physical
interpretation of the former. In this respect the matching
solutions usually provide a much clearer picture.

According to the above requirements, in both cases we shall restrict
attention to spherically symmetric spacetimes which, loosely
speaking, approximate a FLRW solution of standard cosmology for
`large radii' and a non-charged, non-rotating compact object
characterized by the exterior Schwarzschild solution for `small radii'.
(Clearly there must be some characteristic radius in terms of which
`large' and `small' radii are defined.)
Also, one often restricts attention to the spatially flat
FLRW models for simplicity, which also seems justified in view
of current cosmological data which are compatible with spatial
flatness.

Matched solutions

A first approach to the matching idea was initiated by Einstein and Straus
in 1945 and later worked
out in more analytical detail by ~. Here
the matched solution is really such that for radii smaller than a certain
matching radius, R_v (henceforth called the vacuole or
\ radius), it is exactly given by the Schwarzschild
solution (exterior for a black hole, exterior plus interior for a star) and
for radii above this radius it is exactly given by a FLRW universe
for dust matter without cosmological constant (this can be generalized, see
below). The radius R_v is a function of the central gravitational mass
M and the cosmological mass-density , through the latter of which
it also depends on the cosmological time~t. It is determined by

4 3\,R_v^3 =M\,.


This formula holds for flat as well as curved FLRW models if `radius'
is taken to mean `areal radius', the definition of which is that a
two-sphere of areal radius~R has a proper surface area of 4 R^2.
In flat space the areal radius coincides with the proper radius (the
geodesic distance between the center and any point on the sphere), so
that 4 3\,R_v^3 is just the proper volume inside the sphere
of radius~R_v (cf.~Section~).
However, in backgrounds of positive (negative) curvature this expression
is smaller (larger) than the proper volume (the proper volume grows
faster (slower) with areal radius) and hence, for given , the
left-hand side of () is also smaller (larger)
than the proper mass of the dust contained within a sphere of areal
radius~R_v.

Here we recall that the gravitational mass of a lump of matter
is not just proportional to the amount of matter (baryons) in that
region. For example, the kinetic energy as well as the gravitational
binding energy also contribute to the gravitational mass. This is
expressed in formula () of
Appendix~, where further explanations will
be provided. As is well known, the mathematical characterization of
appropriate notions of quasi-local gravitational mass that would
apply to general spacetimes is a notoriously difficult problem to
which various attempts for solutions exist; see
for the current status. However,
in the spherically-symmetric case, to which we restrict attention,
the so-called Misner--Sharp energy gives a satisfying and convenient
concept of active gravitational mass. Its definition will be given
in Section~ and more details, including its
equality in value to the Hawking mass, are discussed in the
Appendices~ and~.

The original construction by Einstein and Straus and its analytical
completion by \ were quite complicated. We will give a
much simpler and conceptually clearer description in
Section~, using a suitable reformulation of the
condition for the matching of solutions. However, it is not hard to
gain some intuitive understanding for the matching construction and
the value of R_v as defined by~().
Let us for the moment restrict to the spatially flat case and consider
the homogeneous and isotropic dust-filled universe at some moment of
time~t. The dust within a 3-ball of proper radius R_v represents an
amount of matter of total mass M as given by~().
Now compress this amount of matter in a spherically symmetric fashion
until it becomes a compact star or a black hole. In Newtonian gravity
the gravitational field outside a spherically symmetric mass
distribution only depends on the total mass and not on its radial
density distribution. This is also true in General Relativity,
which is essentially the content of Birkhoff's theorem.
An elegant proof of Birkhoff's theorem will appear as a
by-product from our considerations in Appendix~.
Hence the above compression preserves equilibrium (albeit an unstable
one, see below) for the dust particles just outside the boundary-sphere of
radius R_v. For radii smaller than R_v we have the Schwarzschild
solution (which is the unique non-trivial spherically symmetric
vacuum solution according to Birkhoff's theorem) which therefore
matches to the FLRW solution for R R_v at the boundary R=R_v
where the matter density is discontinuous. The spatial two-sphere
R=R_v is comoving with the Hubble flow, meaning that its proper
surface area grows in case of expansion. Finally, in case of constant
positive (negative) spatial curvature, () tells us
that the matched Schwarzschild solution has a smaller (larger) mass than
the mass that the amount of dust represents within the ball of areal
radius R_v within the FLRW universe.

The Einstein--Straus model can be generalized in several ways.
Instead of cutting out one ball, one can cut several non-overlapping ones
and fill in the interiors with Schwarzschild geometries of appropriate
masses. For obvious reasons these are sometimes referred to as
`Swiss-Cheese models'. These, in turn, can be generalized to the cases of
non-vanishing cosmological constant~ or non-vanishing
pressure~. Finally, the Einstein--Straus model can be
generalized to spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous
--Tolman--Bondi (LTB) cosmological backgrounds~.

Since for the Einstein--Straus model the geometry within R R_v is
exactly Schwarzschild (for vanishing cosmological constant) or
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetime (for non-vanishing cosmological
constant), it is clear that any dynamical system situated in this
background geometry (no back reaction) only detects that part of
the cosmic expansion that is due to a non-vanishing cosmological
constant. In particular, for vanishing cosmological constant, the
cosmic expansion that goes on outside the expanding vacuole R=R_v is
not felt from within. Hence global expansion due to ordinary
(localizable) matter can, in principle, be completely inhibited
by local inhomogeneities.

There are, however, several severe problems concerning the Einstein--Straus
approach. First of all, it cannot provide a realistic model for the
environment of small structures in our Universe, `small' meaning below the
scales of galaxy clusters or superclusters. To see this, apply
() to a spatially flat universe whose background
matter density is given by the critical density

_crit := 3H_0^28 G\,,

where G is Newton's constant. Then () gives

R_v = (R_S\,R^2_H )^1/3
\, ( MM_ )^1/3 400\,ly \,,

where

alignat2

& R_S&&\,:=\, 2GMc^2
\, \, MM_ \ 3\,km\,,

&R_H&&\,:=\, cH_0
\, \,4\,Gpc 1.3 10^23\,km\,,
alignat

are the Schwarzschild radius for the mass M and the
Hubble radius, respectively.
M_ =2 10^30\,kg is the solar mass.

For a single solar mass this gives a vacuole radius of almost
400 lightyears, which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the
average distance of stars in our Galaxy. Therefore, the
Swiss-Cheese model cannot apply at the scale of stars in galaxies.
This changes as one goes to larger scales. For example, the Virgo
cluster is estimated to have a mass of approximately 10^15 solar
masses~ Their considerations are based on
a LTB model for the cluster., which makes its vacuole radius 10^5
times larger than that for a single solar mass, so that it is approximately
given by 10\,Mpc.
This is just a little smaller than the average distance of groups
and clusters of galaxies within the Virgo supercluster. Hence the
Einstein--Straus approach might well give viable models above cluster
scales. Similar conclusion can be drawn for the vacuole construction
in LTB spacetimes~: There it is argued that the
vacuole might be as big as the Local Group.

The Einstein--Straus solution (as well as its generalization for LTB
spacetimes given by Bonnor) may also be criticized on theoretical grounds.
An obvious one is its dynamical instability: slight perturbations of the
matching radius to larger radii will let it increase without bound, slight
perturbations to smaller radii will let it collapse. This can be proven
formally (e.g.~, Ch.\,3 and~) but
it is also rather obvious, since R_v is defined by the equal and opposite
gravitational pull of the central mass on one side and the cosmological
masses on the other. Both pulls increase as one moves towards their side,
so that the equilibrium position must correspond to a local maximum of
the gravitational potential. Another criticism of the Einstein--Straus
solution concerns the severe restrictions under which it may be
generalized to non spherically-symmetric situations; see
e.g.~.

Melted solutions

The above discussion shows that the Einstein--Straus approach does not
give us useful information regarding the dynamical impact of cosmic
expansion on structures well below the scales of galaxy clusters.
For this reason other exact solutions are sought. In this respect
we wish to remind the reader on the following general aspect: In physics
we are hardly
ever in the position to mathematically rigorously model physically
realistic scenarios. Usually we are at best either able to provide
approximate solutions for realistic models or exact solutions for
approximate models, and in most cases approximations are made on
both sides. The art of physics then precisely consists in finding the
right mixture in each given case. However, in this process our
intuition usually strongly rests on the existence of at least some
`nearby' exact solutions. Accordingly, one seeks exact solutions in
General Relativity that, with some degree of physical approximation,
model a spherically symmetric body immersed in an expanding
universe. However, it is not as easy as one might think at first to
characterize `body' and `immersed'.
In a linear theory, the `simultaneous presence' of two
structures, like a local inhomogeneity in an `otherwise' homogeneous
background, naturally corresponds to the mathematical operation of
addition of the corresponding individual solutions. In a non-linear
theory, however, no such simple recipe exists.
Clearly it is associated with some inhomogeneity
in form of a spatial region with an overdense matter distribution, as
compared to that of the approximately homogeneous distribution far out.
But a body should also be quasi-isolated in order to be distinguishable
form a mere local density fluctuation with smooth transition.
Typical exact solutions that models the latter are the LTB solutions,
in which matter is represented by pressureless dust that freely falls
into the local overdense inhomogeneity. In some sense, these form
the other extreme to the Einstein--Straus solutions in that they
make the transition as smooth and mild as one wishes. Here we shall
be interested in models that somewhat lie in-between these extremes.

An attempt to combine an interior Schwarzschild solution (representing a
star) and a flat FLRW universe was made by Gautreau~.
Here the matter model consists of two components, a perfect fluid
with pressure and equation of state p=p( ) outside the star,
and the superposition of this with the star's dust-matter inside
the star. However, Gautreau also made the assumption that the matter
outside the star moves on radially infalling geodesics, which is only
consistent if the pressure outside is spatially constant. Thus one
is reduced to exact FLRW outside the star~
or the LTB model. (Further remarks may be found in~,
e.g.~p.\,113 and 165.) Other solutions, modeling a black hole in a
cosmological spacetime, have been given in the literature. However, these
solutions model objects which are either
rotating~,
charged~, or both~.
Surveys on the subject of cosmological black holes
are~ and~.
Further interesting solutions are given in~
and in~. The solutions
proposed in the latter two works can be seen as generalizations of
McVittie's model~, which we extensively discuss in
Section~. A crucial feature of these solutions is,
however, that the strength of the inhomogeneity
In Section~ we will identify the
strength of the inhomogeneity with the Weyl part of the Misner--Sharp energy.
varies in time, whereas for the McVittie model it remains constant.
These solutions are of interest in their own right (for a detailed analysis
see~), but our goal here is to focus on the
effects due to cosmological expansion and not on the effects due to a
changing strength of the central inhomogeneity.
The solution proposed in the former work~ is
the melting of a Schwarzschild spacetime in an Einstein's static universe.
This is a purely static solution whose properties and geodesics where studied
in~. For our purposes, however, this
spacetime is not interesting since it is asymptotically an Einstein universe,
and hence not in agreement with the present picture of our Universe at large
scales.

For these reasons in Section~ we shall pay special
attention to the McVittie model. This contains a distinguished central
object in the sense that the mass within a sphere centered at the
inhomogeneity splits into a piece that comes from the continuously
distributed cosmological fluid (with pressure) and a constant piece
that does not depend on the radius of the enclosing sphere; see our
Eq.~(). Moreover, the latter piece is also
constant in time, meaning that the strength of the central inhomogeneity
remains constant. By the way, McVittie's solutions contain the
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter one as a special case, which was recently used
in the literature to estimate the effects of cosmological expansion on
local systems~.
In Section~ we show that in a suitable weak-field
and slow-motion approximation the geodesic equation in McVittie spacetime
reduces to the improved Newtonian equations discussed earlier. An alternative
and more geometric derivation of the improved Newtonian equations for the
McVittie case is presented in Section~ (see
Eq.~()).

Kinematical effects

Timing and distances

Neither the improved Newtonian model nor other general dynamical
arguments make any statement about possible kinematical
effects, i.e.~effects in connection with measurements of
spatial distances and time durations in a cosmological
environment whose geometry changes with time. This is an important
issue if one wants to perform the tracking of a spacecraft, that is
a `mapping out' of its trajectory, which basically means to determine
its simultaneous spatial distance to the observer at given observer times.
But we know from General Relativity that the concepts of `simultaneity'
and `spatial distance' are not uniquely defined. This fact needs to be
taken due care of when analytical expressions for trajectories,
e.g.~solutions to the equations of motion in some arbitrarily chosen
coordinate system, are compared with experimental findings. In those
situations it is likely that different kinematical notions of simultaneity
and distance are involved which need to be properly transformed into each
other before being compared. For example, these transformations can
result in additional acceleration terms involving the product
(). Accordingly, there were claims in the
literature that these kinematical effects could account for the PA;
see e.g.~ and also
statements to the contrary .
In Section~, following
, we will confirm the existence of kinematical
acceleration terms proportional to H_0c, but they are suppressed with
additional powers of =v/c, which renders them irrelevant as far as
the PA is concerned.

Doppler Tracking

The discussion in Section~ is based on
. We explain in some detail the geometric
theory for setting up the kinematical framework in which Doppler
tracking should be discussed in order to properly speak of relative
velocities and accelerations. This is a non-trivial issue which is,
in our opinion, not properly appreciated in the literature on this
subject (related general discussions are ).
Using this setting, we show how to derive an exact Doppler-tracking
formula for a flat FLRW universe. This we use to give reliable
upper bounds for kinematical effects caused by cosmic expansion.
We also discuss generalizations to McVittie spacetime. Even though
such effects exist, they again turn out to be irrelevant for the PA.

Newtonian approach

In order to gain intuition we consider a simple bounded system, say
an atom or a planetary system, immersed in an expanding cosmos.
We ask for the effects of this expansion on our local system.
Does our system expand with the cosmos? Does it expand only partially?
Or does it not expand at all? Here we shall not be concerned with the
far more complex problem of how stable large-scale structures may
emerge from unstable local gravitational dynamics in an expanding
universe. This has been discussed in~
and references therein.

Restricted two-body problem in an expanding universe

We consider the dynamical problem of two bodies attracting
each other via a force with 1/R^2 fall-off. For simplicity
we may think of one mass as being much smaller than the other
one, though this is really inessential. One may think of
two galaxies, a star and a planet, a planet and a spacecraft,
or a (classical) atom given by an electron orbiting around a
proton. The system is placed into an isotropically expanding
ambient universe. We wish to know the leading order influence
of the ambient expansion onto the relative two-body dynamics.

To leading order, the global expansion is described by the
simple linear Hubble law, R=HR, which states that
the relative radial velocity of two comoving objects at a
mutual distance R grows proportional to that distance.
More precisely, the term `distance' is here understood as
the geodesic distance in the spacetime hypersurface of
constant cosmological time~t between its two intersection
points with the two worldlines of the objects considered.
H denotes the
Hubble parameter, which generally depends on t but not
on space. It is given in terms of the scale parameter,
a(t), via H= a/a.

Taking into account H=( a/a)-H^2, the
acceleration that results from the Hubble law is simply given by

R|_cosm. acc.
= HR + H R
= aaR
= -q\,H^2\,R \,,

where

q:=-\, aa a^2
=-\, aa\,H^-2

is the dimensionless deceleration parameter. To get a feeling
for the magnitude, we remark that for the current best-estimates
for the parameters H and q,
H_0 70\,Km s^-1 Mpc^-1 and
q_0 -0.6 respectively, we get
a/a 3 10^-36\,s^-2, which even
at Pluto's distance of 40\,AU merely amounts to a
tiny outward pointing acceleration of
2 10^-23\,m s^-1.

Now note that, in the sense of General Relativity, a body that is
comoving with the cosmological expansion is moving on an inertial
trajectory, i.e.~it is force free. On the other hand, according
to Newton, a dynamical force is, by definition, the cause for
deviations from inertial motion. In the
present context this would mean that dynamical forces are the
causes for deviations from the motions described by
(), which suggests that in Newton's
law, m x= F, we should make the replacement

R R-( a/a)\,R

in order to apply to the (sufficiently slow) motion of interacting
point masses in an expanding universe. Note that this also applies
to gravitational interactions in a Newtonian approximation in which
gravity is considered to be a force in the above sense.

As we will see, the replacement () can be
justified rigorously in a variety of contexts, like for gravitationally
bound systems, using the equation of geodesic deviation in General
Relativity. Whenever we attempt to justify the replacement
() we must not forget that the Newtonian
equations of motion (without Coriolis and centrifugal type `forces' in
them) necessarily refer to preferred systems of coordinates which are
1)~locally non rotating,
2)~whose origin is freely falling, and
3)~in which the coordinate values directly refer to (local) inertial
time (time coordinate) and spatial geodesic distance (space coordinates),
as measured by comoving clocks and rods.
This is achieved by using so-called Fermi normal coordinates (see, e.g.,
\,13.6 of ) in a neighborhood
of a geodesic worldline---e.g.~that of the Sun or the proton. This is also
the approach followed in~. Note that a
Fermi system of coordinates can be defined for worldlines of arbitrary
acceleration and correspond to locally non-rotating frames, which may
physically be realized by a system of at least two non collinear gyros
in torque-free suspensions taken along the worldline. Along a geodesic,
that is a worldline of zero acceleration, this system corresponds to
a local inertial observer and is called Fermi normal.
The equation of geodesic deviation in these coordinates now gives the
variation of the spatial geodesic distance to a neighboring geodesically
moving object, e.g.~a planet or spacecraft. It reads
By construction of the coordinates, the Christoffel symbols
^ _ vanish along the worldline of the first observer.
Since this worldline is geodesic, Fermi--Walker transportation just reduces
to parallel transportation.

d^2x^kd ^2 + R^k_\ 0l0 x^l = 0\,.

Here the x^k are the spatial non-rotating normal coordinates whose
values directly refer to the proper spatial distance. In these
coordinates we further have~

R^k_\ 0l0 = - ^k_l \, a/a

on the worldline of the first observer, where the overdot refers to
differentiation with respect to the cosmological time, which reduces
to the proper time along the observer's worldline.

Equations (,) simply state that
in Fermi normal coordinates around one inertial observer another
nearby inertial observer is radially accelerating away at a magnitude
( a/a)R, just as envisaged before. In linear approximation,
this acceleration has to be added to that resulting from the
other metric perturbation that is caused by the mass at the position
of the first observer. As a result, in the case of purely gravitational
interaction, we obtain the equation of motion of a test particle
(whose metric perturbation we neglect) in the gravitational field
of a heavier object whose metric perturbation away from the FLRW
cosmological background we approximate to linear order.
In the case of charged objects, we neglect the metric
perturbations caused by the masses of both charges as well as
their electromagnetic field, and simply take into account their
mutual electromagnetic interaction.

Neglecting large velocity effects (i.e.~terms quadratic or higher
order in v/c) we can now write down the equation of motion
for the familiar two-body problem. After specification of a scale
function a(t), we get two ODEs for the variables (R, ), which
describe the position Recall that `position' refers to
Fermi normal coordinates, i.e.~R is the radial geodesic distance
to the observer at R=0. of the orbiting body with respect to the
central one:

subequations


& R = L^2R^3 - CR^2 + aaR

&R^2 =L \,.

subequations

These are the ( a/a)--improved Newtonian equations of motion
for the two-body problem, where L represents the (conserved) angular
momentum of the planet (or electron) per unit mass and C the
strength of the attractive force. In the gravitational case C=GM,
where M is the mass of the central body, and in the electromagnetic
case, for the electron-proton system, C=e^2/m (Gaussian unit),

where e and m are the electron's charge and mass, respectively.

In Sections~ and~ we will show how
to obtain () in appropriate limits from the full general
relativistic treatments.

We now wish to study the effect the a term has on the unperturbed
Kepler orbits. We start with the obvious remark that this term results
from the acceleration and not just the expansion of the universe.

Next we point out that in the concrete physical cases
of interest, the time dependence of this term is negligible to a very
good approximation. Indeed, putting f:= a/a, the relative time
variation of the coefficient of R in~() is
f/f. For an exponential scale function a(t) ( t)
(vacuum-energy-dominated universe) this vanishes, and for a power law
a(t) t^ (for example matter-, or
radiation-dominated universes) this is -2H/ , and hence of
the order of the inverse age of the universe. If we consider a planet
in the Solar System, the relevant time scale of the problem is the
period of its orbit around the Sun. The relative error in the
disturbance, when treating the factor a/a as constant during
an orbit, is hence smaller than 10^-9. For atoms it is much smaller,
of course. In principle,
a time varying a/a causes changes in the semi-major
axis and eccentricity of Kepler orbits~.
But here we shall neglect the time-dependence of~()
and set a/a equal to a constant A. Because
of~() we have A:=-q_0H_0^2.
Then () can be immediately integrated:

12 R^2 + U(R) = E\,,

where the effective potential is

U(R)= L^22R^2- CR- A2R^2 \,.

We will see below that the three parameters (L,C,A) can
be effectively reduced to two.

Specifying the initial-value problem

Solutions of () and ()
are specified by initial conditions
(R, R, , )(t_0)=(R_0,V_0, _0, _0)
at the initial time t_0. The discussion of the dynamical behavior of R
is most effectively done in terms of the effective potential. Moreover,
since perturbations are best discussed in terms of dimensionless parameters,
we also introduce a length scale and a time scale that appropriately
characterize the dynamical perturbation and the solution to be perturbed.

The length scale is defined as the radius at which the acceleration due to
the cosmological expansion has the same magnitude as the two-body attraction.
This happens precisely at the critical radius

R_c := ( C|A| )^1/3 \,.

For R<R_c the two-body attraction dominates, whereas for R>R_c
the effect of the cosmological expansion is the dominant one.

In order to gain an understanding of the length scales of the critical radius
it is instructive to express it in terms of the physical parameters. In the
case of gravitational interaction we have C/ A=GM/( q_0H_0^2) and
thus

R_c = ( R_S R_H^22 q_0 )^1/3 \,.

Inserting the approximate value q_0=-1/2 of the present epoch, this
reduces to the \ radius ().

In the electromagnetic case, e.g.~for an electron-proton system, we have
C/ A=(e^2/m)/( q_0H_0^2). Defining, in analogy
with~(), the length scale

R_e := 2e^2mc^2 5.64 10^-15\, m \,,

the critical radius~() becomes

R_c = ( R_e R_H^22 q_0 )^1/3

\, 30 \, AU\,,

where in the last step we inserted q_0=-1/2. This
is about as big as the Neptune orbit!

From~() and~() one sees that,
in both cases, a larger (smaller) q_0 implies a smaller (larger)
critical radius, according to expectations.

So much for the length scale. The time scale is defined to be
the period of the unperturbed Kepler orbit (a solution to the
above problem for A=0) of semi-major axis R_0. By Kepler's
third law it is given by

T_K := 2 ( R_0^3C )^1/2 \,.

It is convenient to introduce two dimensionless parameters which
essentially encode the initial conditions R_0 and _0.

alignat3

& &&\,:=\, ( _02 /T_K )^2
&&\,=\, L^2C R_0\,,

& &&\,:=\,sign(A) ( R_0R_c )^3
&&\,=\, A R_0^3C \, .
alignat

For close to Keplerian orbits is close to one. For reasonably
sized orbits is close to zero. For example, in the Solar
System, where R_0 < 100 AU, one has | | < 10^-16. For an atom
whose radius is smaller than 10^4 Bohr-radii we have | |<10^-57.

Now, defining

x(t):=R(t)/R_0\,,

equations~() and~() can be
written as


& 12 x^2 + (2 /T_K)^2 \, u_ , (x) = e

&x^2 = _0\,,

where e:=E/r_0^2 now plays the role of the energy-constant and
where the reduced two-parameter effective potential u_ ,
is given by

u_ , (x) := 2x^2
- 1x
- 2 x^2\,.

The initial conditions now read


(x, x, , )(t_0) = (1,V_0/R_0, _0, _0)\,.

The point of introducing the dimensionless variables is that the
three initial parameters (L,C,A) of the effective potential
could be reduced to two: and . This will be
convenient in the discussion of the potential.

Discussion of the reduced effective potential

Circular orbits correspond to extrema of the effective
potential~(). Expressed in terms of the
dimensionless variables this is equivalent to
u'_ , (1) = - + 1 - = 0.
By its very definition~(), is always
non-negative, implying 1. For negative (decelerating
case) this is always satisfied. On the contrary, for positive
(accelerating case), this implies, in view of~(), the
existence of a critical radius, given by R_c, beyond which no circular
orbit exists.
These orbits are stable if the considered extremum is a true minimum,
i.e.~if the second derivative of the potential evaluated at the
critical value is positive. Now,
u''_ , (1)=3 -2- =1-4 , showing stability
for < 1/4 and instability for 1/4. For the
accelerating case, in view of~(), this implies that
the circular orbits are stable iff R_0 is smaller than the critical value

R_ sco := (1/4)^1/3 R_c 0.63 \,R_c \,,

where `sco' stands for `stable circular orbits'.

Summarizing, we have the following situation: in the decelerating case
(i.e.~for negative or, equivalently, for negative A) stable
circular orbits exist for every radius R_0; one just has to increase
the angular velocity by some amount stated below in
(). On the contrary, in the accelerating case
(i.e.~for positive , or, equivalently, for positive A),
we have three regions:

itemize
R_0 < R_ sco,
where circular orbits exist and are stable,
R_ sco R_0 R_c,
where circular orbits exist but are unstable, and
R_0 > R_c,
where no circular orbits exist.
itemize

Generally, there exist no bounded orbits that extend beyond the
critical radius R_c, the reason being simply that there is no
R>R_c where U'(R)>0. Bigger systems will just be slowly
pulled apart by the cosmological acceleration and approximately
move with the Hubble flow at later times. This genuine
non-perturbative behavior was not seen in the perturbation analysis
performed in . Modifications of this
strict qualitative distinction implied by time dependencies of A
in () were discussed in~.

Turning back to the case of circular orbits, we now express the
condition for an extrema derived above, =1- , in
terms of the physical quantities, which leads to

_0 = (2 /T_K) 1-sign(A)(R_0/R_c)^3 \,.

This equation says that, in order to get a circular orbit, our planet,
or electron, must have a smaller or bigger angular velocity according
to the universe expanding in an accelerating or decelerating fashion,
respectively. This is just what one would expect, since the effect of
a cosmological `pulling apart' or `pushing together' must be
compensated by a smaller or larger centrifugal forces respectively,
as compared to the Keplerian case. Equation~()
represents a modification of the third Kepler law due to the
cosmological expansion. In principle this is measurable, but it is
an effect of order (R_0/R_c)^3 and hence very small indeed;
e.g.~smaller than 10^-17 for a planet in the Solar System.

Instead of adjusting the initial angular velocity as
in~(), we can ask how one has to modify
r_0 in order to get a circular orbit with the angular velocity
_0=2 /T_K. This is equivalent to searching the minimum
of the effective potential~() for =1.
This condition leads to the fourth order equation
x^4 - x + 1 = 0 with respect to x. Its solutions can be
exactly written down using Ferrari's formula, though this is not
illuminating. For our purposes it is more convenient to solve it
approximately, treating as a small perturbation.
Inserting the ansatz x_min=c_0+c_1 + ( ^2) we get
c_0=c_1=1. This is really a minimum since
u''_1, (x_min)=1+ ( )>0. Hence we have

R_ min = R_0
( 1 + sign(A) ( R_0R_c )^3
+ ( (R_0/R_c)^6 )
)

This tells us that in the accelerating (decelerating) case the radii of
the circular orbits with _0=2 /T_K becomes bigger (smaller),
again according to physical expectation. As an example, the deviation
in the radius for an hypothetical spacecraft orbiting around the Sun
at 100~AU would be just of the order of 1~mm. Since it grows with the
fourth power of the distance, the deviation at 1000~AU would be of
the order of 10 meters.

General-relativistic treatment for electromagnetically-bounded systems

In this section we show how to arrive at ()
from a relativistic treatment of an electromagnetically
bounded two-body system embedded (without back-reaction) into
an expanding (spatially flat) universe.
This implies solving Maxwell's equations in the cosmological
background~() for an electric point charge (the
proton) and then integrate the Lorentz equations for the motion of
a particle (electron) in a bound orbit (cf.~).
Equation~() then appears in an appropriate
slow-motion limit. However, in order to relate this straightforward
method to a famous argument of Dicke \& Peebles, we shall proceed
by taking a slight detour which makes use of the conformal properties
of Maxwell's equations.

The argument of Dicke and Peebles

In reference~ Dicke \& Peebles presented
an apparently very general and elegant argument that purports
to show the insignificance of any dynamical effect of cosmological
expansion on a local system that is either bound by electromagnetic or
gravitational forces and which should hold true at any scale.
Their argument involves a rescaling of spacetime
coordinates, (t, x) ( t, x) and
certain assumptions on how other physical quantities, most prominently
mass, behave under such scaling transformations. For example, they
assume mass to transform like m ^-1m. However, their
argument is really independent of such assumptions, as we shall
show below. We work from first principles to clearly display all
assumptions made.

We consider the motion of a charged point particle in an
electromagnetic field. The whole system, i.e.~particle plus
electromagnetic field, is placed into a cosmological FLRW-spacetime
with flat (k=0) spatial geometry. The spacetime metric reads

= c^2\, t^2 - a^2(t) ( r^2 + r^2\, )\,,

where

= ^2 + ^2 \, ^2

denotes the metric on the unit two-sphere in standard coordinates.
We introduce conformal time, t_c, via


t_c=f(t):= ^t_k dt'a(t')\,,

by means of which we can write () in a
conformally flat form

= a_c^2(t_c) (c^2\, t_c^2- r^2-r^2\, )
= a_c^2(t_c)\, \,,

where denotes the flat Minkowski metric.
Here we wrote a_c to indicate that we now expressed the expansion
parameter a as function of t_c rather than t, i.e.

a_c:=a f^-1\,.

The electromagnetic field is characterized by the tensor
F_ , comprising electric and magnetic fields:

F_ =
pmatrix
0 & E_n/c
-E_m/c & - _mnjB_j
pmatrix\,.

In terms of the electromagnetic four-vector potential,
A_ =( /c,- A), one has


F_ = _ A_ - _ A_
= _ A_ - _ A_ \,,

so that, as usual, E=- - A.
The expression for the four-vector of the Lorentz-force of a particle
of charge e moving in the field F_ is
e\,F^ _ u^ , where u^ is the
particle's four velocity.

The equations of motion for the system Particle + EM-Field
follow from an action which is the sum of the action of the
particle, the action for its interaction with the electromagnetic
field, and the action for the free field, all placed in the
background (). Hence we write:

S=S_P+S_I+S_F\,,


where

Here is an arbitrary parameter along the worldline
z: z( ) of the particle, and z'
the derivative dz/d . The differential of the
proper time along this worldline is

d = g(z',z')\,d
= g_ (z( )) dz^ d
dz^ d \,d \,.

It is now important to note that 1)~the background metric g
does not enter () and that ()
is conformally invariant (in 4 spacetime dimensions only!). Hence
the expansion factor, a(t_c), does not enter these two
expressions. For this reason we could write ()
in terms of the flat Minkowski metric, though it should be kept
in mind that the time coordinate is now given by conformal time
t_c. This is not the time read by standard clocks that
move with the cosmological observers, which rather show the
cosmological time t (which is the proper time along the
geodesic flow of the observer field / t).

The situation is rather different for the action ()
of the particle. Its variational derivative with respect to
z( ) is

S_p z^ ( )= -mc\, \
12g_ , \,z'^ z'^ g(z',z')
- dd [ g_ z'^ g(z',z')
] \ \, .


We now introduce the conformal proper time, _c, via

d _c = (1/c)\, (z',z')\,d
= (1/ca)\, g(z',z')\,d \,.

We denote differentiation with respect to _c by an overdot,
so that e.g.~z'/ g(z',z')= z/ca. Using this to replace
z' by z g(z',z')/ca and also g by a^2 in
() gives

S_p z^ ( )=
g(z',z')ac\,ma\, \
_ z^ - P^ _ _, \


where we set

a=: ( /c^2)

P^ _ := ^ _ -
z^ z^ c^2 _ \,.

Recalling that
S_P= S_p z^ ( ) z^ d =
S_p z^ ( _c) z^ d _c and
using (), () is equivalent to

S_p z^ ( _c)=
ma ( z^ - P^ _ _, )\,,


where from now on we agree to raise and lower indices using the
Minkowski metric, i.e.~ _ =diag(1,-1,-1,-1) in Minkowski
inertial coordinates.

Writing () in terms of the conformal proper time
and taking the variational derivative with respect to z( _c)
leads to S_I/ z^ ( _c)=-eF_ z^ ,
so that

S z^ ( _c)
=ma ( z_ - P^ _ _, )
-e\,F_ z^ \,.

The variational derivative of the action with respect to the
vector potential A is

S A_ (x)
= _ F^ (x)
-e\, d _c\, (x-z( _c))\, z^ ( _c)\,.

Equations~() and~() show that the
fully dynamical problem can be treated as if it were situated in static
flat space. The field equations that follow from ()
are just the same as in Minkowski space. Hence we can calculate the Coulomb
field as usual. On the other hand, the equations of motion receive two
changes from the cosmological expansion term: the first is that the mass
m is now multiplied with the (time-dependent!) scale factor a, the
second is an additional scalar force induced by a. Note that all spacetime
dependent functions on the right hand side are to be evaluated at the
particle's location z( _c), whose fourth component corresponds to
ct_c. Hence, writing out all arguments and taking into account that the
time coordinate is t_c, we have for the equation of motion

& - (-c ^ 0+ z^ z^0/c )
\,a'_c(z^0/c)/a_c(z^0/c)\,,
alignat
subequations

where a'_c is the derivative of a_c.

So far no approximations were made. Now we write z^ = (c, v),
where v is the derivative of z with respect to the
conformal time t_c, henceforth denoted by a prime, and
=1/ 1-v^2/c^2. Then we specialize to slow motions,
i.e.~neglect effects of quadratic or higher powers in v/c (special
relativistic effects). For the spatial part of () we get

z + z\ (a'_c/a_c)
= ema_c ( E + z B )\,,

where we once more recall that the spatial coordinates used here are
the comoving (i.e.~conformal) ones and the electric and
magnetic fields are evaluated at the particle's position z(t_c).

From the above equation we see that the effect of cosmological expansion
in the conformal coordinates shows up in two ways: first in a time
dependence of the mass which scales with a_c, and, second, in the
presence a friction term. Dicke \& Peebles neglect the friction term
and simply conclude as follows: In the adiabatic approximation, which
is justified if typical time scales of the problem at hand are short
compared to the world-age (corresponding to small _ 2
in ()), the time-dependent mass term leads to a
time varying radius in comoving (or conformal) coordinates of
r(t_c) 1/a_c(t_c). Hence the physical radius (given by the
cosmological geodesically spatial distance), r_*=a_c r, stays
constant in this approximation. Hence, within this
approximation, electromagnetically bound systems do not feel
any effect of cosmological expansion.

But what does `this approximation' refer to? We will see that it amounts
to neglecting precisely the leading order contributions. This is easy to
see if we cast () into physical coordinates,
given by the cosmological time t and the cosmological geodesic
spatial distance r_*:=a(t)r. We have dt_c/dt=1/a
and the spatial geodesic coordinates are y:= a(t) z.
Denoting by an overdot the time derivative with respect to t,
the two terms on the left hand side of~() become

subequations

a( y - y\, a/a)\,,

z(a_c'/a_c) &\,=-&&a( yH^2- yH)\,,

subequations

where H= a/a. This shows that the friction term cancels against the
first-order derivative terms in y and a that one gets in rewriting
the left-hand side of~() in physical coordinates.
Since the friction term cancels, the critical
remark [27] in regarding its magnitude is based
on a misunderstanding.
The only additional term next to y that survives is precisely
the familiar acceleration term~(). Inserting
() into (), whose right-hand side
we now specialize to a pure electric Coulomb field,
E( z)=Q z/| z\,|^3 and B( z) = 0, we
arrive at

y - y\ ( a/a) = eQm | y|^3 y \,.

After introducing polar coordinates in the orbital plane we exactly
get~().

Exact condition for non-expanding circular orbits

In~ a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of non-expanding orbits is derived for the electron-proton
system in a spatially flat FLRW spacetime. Here `non-expanding' is
defined as of constant areal radius. This condition follows directly from the
Lorentz equation of motion for the electron in the external electric field of
the proton, the normalization condition of the electron's four-velocity, and
the condition of constancy of the areal radius. In our notation, introducing
the dimensionless quantities h(t):=RH(t)/c, l:=L/Rc, and :=R_e/2R,
the conditions for the existence of non-expanding circular orbits reads as
follows:

Rc h = (1-h^2)^3/2(1+l^2)^1/2
( - l^2+h^2 (1+l^2)(1-h^2) ) \,.

Recall that R_e is defined in~() and H(t)
and L denote the Hubble function and, respectively, the (conserved)
electron's angular momentum per unit mass.
The above condition is a first-order autonomous ODE for the function h(t),
and hence for the Hubble function H(t). This is the constraint on the
spacetime (more precisely, on the scale factor a(t)) that one gets by
imposing the existence of non-expanding circular orbits for two oppositely
charged point masses. If such orbits exist, ()
amounts to the generalization of Kepler's third law to FLRW spacetimes, which
here gives a relation between the scale function on one hand and the orbital
parameters R and L as well as the field-strength parameter R_e on the
other. Recall that in Newtonian physics the third Kepler law is, in our
notation, simply given by l^2= .

The easiest solutions of~() are of course the
stationary ones, that is with h(t) h_0, for some constant
h_0. This means that the scale factors is exponentially expanding,

a(t)=a_0 (H_0 t) \,,

where H_0:=h_0 c/R and a_0 is some positive constant. In other
words, the spacetime is given by the de\,Sitter solution
( -dominated universe). In this
case~() reduces to

l^2+h_0^2 (1+l^2)(1-h_0^2) = \,.

Notice that a larger Hubble parameter, hence a larger h_0, makes the
l.h.s.~larger. Consequently, ()
tells us that with a larger Hubble parameter we must give to the electron
a smaller angular velocity (smaller l) in order to keep it on a
non-expanding circular orbit with the same radius. This, according
to intuition, is in order to compensate the extra cosmological pull
with a reduced centrifugal term. In case of Minkowski spacetime (h_0=0)
the above relation reads l^2/ 1+l^2= , hence one can interpret
the factor 1/ 1+l^2 as a special-relativistic correction to the
Newtonian relation l^2= .
The largest radius at which, in an FLRW spacetime with exponentially-growing
scale factor, there is a non-expanding orbit follows
from~() in the limit l 0.
In this limit the condition reduces to h_0^2/ 1-h_0^2= , which,
for small parameters h_0, simplifies to h_0^2 . Solving for
R this gives the radius (R_e R_H^2/2)^1/3, which, taking into account
that q_0=-1 because of~(), exactly corresponds to the
critical radius~().

The other (non-stationary) solutions of~()
can also be found. After separation of variables and an elementary
integration one gets t as function of h in terms of trigonometric
functions composed with inverse hyperbolic functions. This exact
expression is again not very illuminating and cannot generally be explicitly
inverted so as to obtain h in terms of elementary functions of t.
However, if we make use of the smallness of the parameters ,
l^2, and h^2, a leading-order expansion in these quantities gives a
much simpler expression for t(h) which can be explicitly inverted.
In fact, this approximate solution h(t) is obtained much quicker by solving
() with the right-hand side being replaced
with its leading-order expansion in the mentioned quantities, that is,
by solving

Rc h = -l^2 - h^2 \,.

Here -l^2 is a constant which depends on the orbit parameters.
One must now distinguish between three cases:
(a)~ -l^2=: ^2>0 for some positive ,
(b)~ -l^2=:- ^2<0 for some positive , and
(c)~ -l^2=0. Recalling the Newtonian relation l^2= , orbits in
the three cases have an angular momentum which is, respectively, smaller,
bigger, and equal to the Newtonian one. Integrating~()
we get, putting w.l.o.g.~t_0=0,
h(t)= ( c t/R),
h(t)=- ( c t/R), and
h(t)=R/ct, for the cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively.
Then, integrating once and exponentiating the result, we get the corresponding
scale functions:

In all three cases (a), (b), and (c) a_0 is a positive constant and the
acceleration term a/a is a constant which is positive, negative,
and zero, respectively. Hence, as one would intuitively expect, the
non-expanding orbits have an angular momentum which is smaller, larger, or
equal the Newtonian one, depending on whether the acceleration factor
a/a is positive, negative, or zero.

General-relativistic treatment for gravitationally-bounded systems

As advertised in Section~, we now wish to discuss
exact solutions that may represent quasi-isolated spherically-symmetric
gravitating systems `embedded' into cosmological spacetimes. As regards
the meaning of `embedded' we distinguish between the strategies of
`matching' and `melting', as outlined in Sect.\,.

Spherically-symmetric matchings

The complexity and non-linearity of Einstein's equations make it
a very difficult task to construct a suitable variety of exact
solutions which serve as realistic models for actual physical
situations. Often exact solutions are only known for highly
idealized situations, typically with high degrees of symmetry,
in which the field equations sufficiently simplify. One way to
construct new solutions (in a suitable sense, see below) from
old ones is to glue them across suitably chosen hypersurfaces
along which the matter distribution may become singular due to
surface layers. This approach was pioneered by Lanczos in the
early 1920s~ and put into geometric form
by Darmois~ and ; see
also \,21.13 of~.
In this section, under the assumption of spherically symmetry,
we present a new alternative set of conditions which are
equivalent to the old ones. The new conditions only
involve scalar quantities, are easy to verify, and have good
physical interpretations. More details are contained
in~.

Here we shall restrict to piecewise continuous matter distributions
without singular ( -distribution like) surface layers, as e.g.~in
the presence of stars with sharply defined surfaces. Einstein's
equations can the be satisfied for piecewise twice continuously
differentiable fields, if the field equations at the location of the
matching hypersurface are replaced by their one-dimensional
-interval integrals in normal direction to the
hypersurface. The condition that two twice continuously
differentiable solutions (in the ordinary sense) can be matched
into a piecewise twice continuously differentiable solution
(in the re-interpreted sense just explained) is then simply
given by the so-called

Darmois
For a non-null matching hypersurface , (i)~the induced metric
and (ii)~the extrinsic curvature _ shall be continuous
through~ .
Darmois

Let us pause for a moment to say a few more words about the notion
of `continuity through '. Gluing together two pieces of
spacetimes means the following: Initially one has two spacetimes,
say ( ^+, ^+) and ( ^-, ^-), with oriented boundaries
^+ and ^-, respectively. Given a diffeomorphism
: : ^+ ^- between the boundaries,
the glued spacetime is the quotient of the disjoint union of ^+
and ^- under the identification of each point of p ^+
with (p) ^-. The matching hypersurface
is now the common image of ^+ and ^- after
identification in the quotient spacetime. Now, a tensor field
is said to be continuous through if |_ ^+
equals |_ ^- under the push-forward action of the
diffeomorphism , hence if
_*( |_ ^+)= |_ ^-.

Let us now return to the DJC and, in particular, their physical
interpretation. If is a continuous choice of unit normal
of , it implies that

( , ) \; is continuous through \,.

This follows directly from the expressions~() of the
Einstein tensor given in Appendix~. If
is timelike and hence spacelike, ()
just states the continuity of the normal components for the
energy-momentum flux-densities, whereas their tangential components
together with the energy density may jump across .
In the absence of surface layers this continuity condition is just
a physically obvious consequence of local energy-momentum conservation,
whereas jumps in, say, the energy-density must clearly be allowed for.
For completeness we note that for a spacelike matching surface
() states the continuity of the
densities of energy and momentum as measured by an observer moving
along (taken to be future pointing), whereas the corresponding
currents may jump.

Let now restrict our attention to spherical symmetric spacetimes
glued along hypersurfaces of spherical symmetry. This means that
the latter are left invariant, as set, under the action of SO(3).
We recall that the structure of a spherically symmetric spacetime
is that of a warped product = _R of a two-dimensional
Lorentzian manifold and the two-sphere by means of the warping
function, R: R_+, called the areal radius.
The matching hypersurfaces are then of the form
= _R , where is the projection
of into and is called the matching curve. The
DJC should then reduce to appropriate conditions along the curve
. Indeed, Theorem~ below shows that,
in the spherically symmetric case, the DJC are equivalent to the
following

SSJC
Let be a smooth, non-null, spherically symmetric matching
hypersurface between two spherically symmetric spacetimes and a
continuous choice of unit normal vector field on . Denote

SSJC

The Misner--Sharp (MS) energy~
and~, which we will denote by E,
is a concept of quasi-local mass that can be defined in presence of
spherical symmetry, and which proves useful for computational and
interpretational purposes. It is a function defined in purely
geometrical manner as follows. Given a point p of spacetime,
compute the sectional curvature K of the plane tangent to the
two-dimensional SO(3)-orbit through p and multiply this with minus
The minus sign here is just a relict of our signature
choice. one-half of the third power of the areal radius:

E := - 12 R^3 K \,.

From () we immediately read
off

E = R2 ( 1 + R R ) \,,

which provides a convenient expression for the computation of the MS
energy. We shall show in Appendix~ that
the MS energy is the charge of a conserved current and how it depends on the
energy-momentum tensor for the matter. There we will also briefly discuss
its Newtonian limit. This allows
to interpret it as amount of active gravitational energy contained in the
interior of the sphere of symmetry (SO(3)-orbit) through p. There we
also show that the MS energy at p is equal to the Hawking quasi-local
mass of the two-sphere of symmetry (SO(3)-orbit) through p and hence
converges to the Bondi-mass at null infinity and, in an asymptotically
flat spacetime, to the ADM mass at spatial infinity (for the latter two
issues see and also~).
Moreover, we will give the decomposition of the MS energy in its Ricci and
Weyl parts; see~().

The name `Misner--Sharp energy' seems now to be established in the
literature, however one should say that this mass concept goes back at
least to~
For an English translation see~.
, which gives a coordinate expression for it. Its
geometric definition~() was first given
in~ and its interpretation as the charge of a
conserved current was first derived in~. Later, an
alternative definition was given in~: There it is showed
that the MS energy can defined in terms of the norm of the Killing
fields generating the isometry group SO(3), leading directly
to~(). Further relevant studies of the MS energy
are~ and, more
recently,~.

Some comment are needed on the above SSJC.
First we note that, since and are spherically symmetric and
hence tangent to we have in view of~()
and~() that ( , _ )
= ( _ ,\! _ _ _ )
= ( _ )\, _ ^ ( _ , _ ).
Hence, the quantity in (ii) is indeed (up to a possible sign) the
extrinsic curvature of the curve in . Second, note that this
quantity, being quadratic in , does not depend on the sign choice of
.
Third, since the matching hypersurface has the structure
, the words `continuous through the curve~ ' can
be interchanged with the words `continuous through the hypersurface~
', depending on ones preference to think four- or two-dimensional.

A great advantage of the SSJC is that they are very easy to verify: one
simply has to impose continuity on four scalars along the matching
curve in the two-dimensional base manifold . Dealing with scalars, since
their value is independent on the particular coordinate choice, one does
not need to worry about introducing new coordinates in both spacetimes
to be glued, in order to get the different metrics in a form which is
comparable. This is indeed an ingrate task: in general, these coordinates
are only needed in order to check if the junction conditions are satisfied,
and for nothing more. In presence of spherical symmetry all this can be
circumvented by using our new junction conditions.

Furthermore, the SSJC have a good physical interpretation: The continuity
condition of both, the areal radius as well as of the MS energy, can be
read as equilibrium condition for the gravitational pull acting from
opposite directions onto (fictitious) test masses at the location of the
matching surface. Concerning the continuity of the extrinsic curvature of
the matching curve, we note the following: In the case where the matching
hypersurface is timelike, let = ( ) be a
timelike curve in and is future-pointing tangent.
One can think of as the `matching observer's' worldline.
Hence, in the timelike case, the extrinsic curvature is nothing but
the acceleration of the matching observer. In the spatial case, on
the contrary, is timelike, is spacelike (and
tangent to it). One can choose to be future-pointing and then
think of it as an observer field defined along the spatial (1-dimensional)
slice . In view of~() one
then sees that the extrinsic curvature of is exactly
Recall that, because of our signature choice, the restriction
of the metric to spacelike directions is negative definite.
the shear-expansion of in direction of `radial direction'.

In Appendix~ we prove the following

thm[Equivalence of the junction conditions]
Let be a smooth, non-null, spherically symmetric matching
hypersurface between two spherically symmetric spacetimes and a
continuous choice of unit normal vector field on .
Assume, moreover, that the areal radii of the two spacetimes are C^1
functions in an open neighborhood of the matching hypersurfaces.
Then the DJC are equivalent to the SSJC.
thm

Now let us suppose we are faced with the following situation: We are given
two spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein equation and we want to
know if they can be matched together at all, and if so, how to characterize
the curve (respectively, the hypersurface ) along which
this is possible. Answers to these questions will be provided by the
junction conditions SSJC. Note that a timelike or spacelike curve in the
two-dimensional base manifold ( , _ ) can be described simply by a
function R( ), where R is the areal radius and the curve's
arc-length which, in the timelike case, corresponds to the matching
observer's proper time.
The conditions (i) and (iii) of the SSJC are then equivalent to the
condition that the functional dependence R( ) must be the same
(up to a trivial translation in ) in both spacetimes to be
matched.

The Eisenstaedt theorem

Perhaps the simplest attempt to model a compact body (star) in an expanding
universe is trying to inglobate it in a FLRW spacetime and to assume, for
simplicity, that the body is spherically symmetric. A direct consequence of
the SSJC is the following intuitive appealing theorem due to
Eisenstaedt~:

thm[Eisenstaedt, 1977]
Excise the full world-tube W_r_0 of a comoving ball of comoving
radius r_0 from a FLRW spacetime and insert instead a spherical symmetric
inhomogeneity (hence a piece of a spherically symmetric spacetime together
with a related matter model, satisfying Einstein's equations).
Then a necessary condition for the resulting spacetime to satisfy Einstein's
equation is that the MS energy of the inserted inhomogeneity equals
that of the excised ball.
thm


This says that the mean energy density (measured with the
MS energy) of spherically-symmetric inhomogeneities must be the same as the
one of the FLRW spacetime. That the Eisenstaedt Theorem is a consequence
of the Darmois junction conditions was already pointed out in~.

The Einstein--Straus vacuole revisited

As another application of the above described matching procedure we revisit
the Einstein--Straus solution~
,
which originally consists on a Schwarzschild spacetime (called `vacuole')
matched to a dust FLRW universe with zero cosmological constant. Later,
this model was generalized also to the case of a non-vanishing cosmological
constant~. We treat here the general case of an
arbitrary cosmological constant and show that the SSJC allow substantial
simplifications of the computations. This technique can also be applied
to Bonnor's vacuole construction in LTB spacetimes.

Notice that the matching condition~()
implies, in particular, that the pressure must be continuous through the
matching hypersurface. Since the interior is a vacuum spacetime, it follows
that the pressure must vanishes also on the exterior part of the matching
hypersurface and hence everywhere on the FLRW spacetime. That is why one
has to restrict to dust FLRW spacetimes.

Since we leave the cosmological constant arbitrary (it may be
positive, negative, or zero) the inner region is given, respectively, by a
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter, Schwarzschild--anti-de\,Sitter
The Schwarzschild--(anti-)\,de\,Sitter metric ()
is often called the Kottler solution, after Friedrich Kottler, who was the
first to write down this metric in~. More details on
its analytic and global structure may be found in~.,
or Schwarzschild spacetime (all abbreviated henceforth by SdS). Recall
that the SdS spacetime is given by the vacuum solution to Einstein equation
with cosmological term

where

V(R) = 1 - 2mR - 3R^2 \,.

Above, denotes the metric on the unit two-sphere~()
and m is a constant which represents the central mass.

A dust FLRW spacetime is given by the metric

^ FLRW = t^2
-a(t)^2 ( r^21-kr^2 + r^2 )

together with the matter energy-momentum tensor
Throughout we denote the metric-dual (1-form) of a vector
by underlining it, that is, \,:= ( ,\, \,) is
the 1-form metric-dual to vector . In local coordinates we have
=u^ _ and \,=u_ x^ , where
u_ :=g_ u^ .
= \, , where = / t
is the (geodesic) velocity field of the cosmological dust and
is the matter energy density, which depends on t only. Here r
is the comoving radial coordinate and k is a constant which takes
the values 0,-1,+1, depending on whether the spatial slices have
zero, negative, or positive curvature, respectively. The Einstein
equation is then equivalent to the following set given by the
Friedmann equation and a `conservation equation':

subequations


& ( aa )^2 + ka^2
- Ca^3 - 3 = 0 \,,

&\; a^3 = constant,

subequations

where the constant C:=8 _ 0a^3_ 0/3 depends on the
initial conditions a_ 0:=a(t_ 0) and
_ 0:= (t_ 0) at some `initial' time t_ 0.
Here, the dot denotes differentiation with respect to t or, which is the
same, along .

The central question is now the following: How shall we cut hypersurfaces
_ SdS = _ SdS and
_ FLRW = _ FLRW in the
spacetimes SdS and, respectively, FLRW in order that the resulting
pieces can be matched? In order to apply the SSJC we have to compute
the MS energy for both spacetimes. For the FLRW spacetime one has
R_ FLRW(t,r)=a(t)r and hence
R_ FLRW = a r t + a r and
R R_ FLRW=g^ R_, R_,
=r^2(k+ a^2)-1. From
the definition~() one then gets, using Friedmann's equation,

E_ FLRW = 4 3R_ FLRW^3( + _ ) \,,

where _ := /8 is the energy density associated with
the cosmological constant. Notice that this expression, as well its
derivation, is completely independent of the specific equation of state of
the fluid and does not depend on the spatial curvature k.
For the SdS case one has R_ SdS=R and thus
R R_ SdS=-V(R) and

E_ SdS = m + 4 3R_ SdS^3 _ \,.

Now, the last two conditions of the SSJC, that is the continuity of areal
radius and MS energy across the matching hypersurface (yet to be
determined), are equivalent to the continuity of the areal radius
R_ FLRW=R_ SdS=:R, together with the suggestive relation

m = 4 3R^3 \,.

This two conditions already determine the matching hypersurface. Indeed,
inserting R=R_ FLRW=a(t)r in~() and
using the relation (t)a^3(t)=const. valid for dust FLRW
models, one obtains the matching radius in terms of the FLRW comoving
radial coordinate:

r = r_0
:= ( m(4 /3)a_ 0^3 _ 0 )^1/3
=constant\,.

Here a_ 0:=a(t_ 0), and similarly for , where
t_ 0 is some fixed `initial' time.
This means that the matching observer moves, in the FLRW spacetime,
along the integral curve of = / t with initial
condition (t_ 0,r_ 0) and hence is comoving with the cosmological
matter.

So far we used the last two of the SSJC. As discussed above, the continuity
of the areal radius and the arc-length (the proper time, in the timelike
case) of the matching curve are equivalent to the equality of the functional
dependencies R( ) (up to a possible trivial translation in ) which
describe the matching curves in the two spacetimes to be matched.
Now, because of~(), the matching curve
(worldline) in the FLRW spacetime is simply

R( ) = a( )r_ 0 \,,

where a is the (unique) solution of the Friedmann
equation~() with initial condition a_ 0 at
_ 0=t_ 0. (Recall that in FLRW the proper time of an observer
moving along an integral line of equals the cosmological time, hence
=t.) From what we said above, the same functional relation R( )
must hold also in the SdS---provided we identify R with the areal radius
and with the matching observer's proper time, both referred to the
SdS spacetime. This determines the matching curve in SdS.

Finally we need to show that the junction condition~(ii) is satisfied,
hence that the matching observer's accelerations coincide. Looking at the
matching worldline from the FLRW spacetime, it is immediately clear that
it is geodesic, hence its acceleration vanishes.
To conclude the matching procedure, we just have to check that this is also
true for the matching worldline in the SdS spacetime. For this, one has just
to check that the function defined in~()
satisfies the geodesic equation for a radial motion. The latter is given by

R^2 + V(R) = e^2 \,,

where e:= ^ SdS( / T, )=constant and
= T~ / T+ R~ / R is the
matching observer in the SdS spacetime. (Equation~()
can be quickly derived from the fact that
( ^ SdS( / T, ))=0, since
/ T is Killing and geodesic. Inserting
e:= ^ SdS( / T, )=V(R) T in the normalization
condition 1= ^ SdS( , )=V(R) T^2- R^2/V(R) one arrives
immediately at~().)
Now, inserting~()
with~() in~() and
using the Friedmann equation~(), one gets
R^2 + V(R) = 1-k r_ 0^2. Hence, the geodesic
equation~() is satisfied (with e^2=1-kr_ 0^2)
and herewith all the four junction conditions.

The McVittie model

Among all models discussed in the literature which represent a
quasi-isolated spherically-symmetric gravitating system melted into a
cosmological spacetime, the one that is presumably best understood as
regards its analytical structure as well as its physical assumptions is
that of McVittie~, thanks to the careful analysis
of Nolan~. Here we shall
restrict to the `flat' or k=0 model, which interpolates between an
exterior Schwarzschild solution, describing a local mass, and a spatially
flat (i.e.~k=0) ambient FLRW universe. For simplicity we shall from now
on refer to this model simply as the McVittie model.
The cosmological constant is assumed to be zero, although this
assumption is not essential (see the last paragraph of
Section~).

This is not to say that this model is to be taken at face value
in all its aspects. Its problems lie in the region very close to
the central object, where the basic assumptions on the behavior
of matter definitely turn unphysical. However, at radii much
larger than (in geometric units) the central mass (to be defined
below) the k=0 McVittie solution seems to provide a viable
approximation for the transition between a homogeneous cosmological
spacetime and a localized mass immersed in it. We will now briefly
discuss this model and look at its geodesic equations, showing
that they reduces to~() in an appropriate
weak-field and slow-motion limit. This provides another and more
solid justification for the Newtonian approach we carried out in
Section~.

The characterization of the McVittie model is made through two sets
of a\,priori specifications. The first set concerns the metric
(left side of Einstein's equations) and the second set the matter
(right side of Einstein's equations). The former consists in an
ansatz for the metric, which can formally be described as follows:
Write down the Schwarzschild metric for the mass parameter m in
isotropic coordinates, add a conformal factor a^2(t) to the
spatial part, and allow the mass parameter m to depend on time.
Hence the metric reads

split
=& ( 1-m(t)/2r1+m(t)/2r )^2 t^2
-& ( 1+ m(t)2r )^4 a^2(t)\ ( r^2 + r^2 )\,,
split

where is given by~(). The metric
() is obviously spherically symmetric with
the spheres of constant radius r being the orbits of the rotation
group. We will discuss below what this ansatz actually entails.
For later convenience we also introduce the orthonormal tetrad
\ _ \_ =0, , 3 with respect to
(), where
We write := ( , ) .

_ := / x^ ^-1\, / x^

and \x^ \=\t,r, , \.

The second set of specifications, concerning the matter, is as follows:
The matter is a perfect fluid with density and isotropic
pressure p. Hence its energy-momentum tensor is given by

= \, +p\,( - )\,.

Furthermore, and this is where the two sets of specifications make
contact, the motion of the matter is given by

= _0 \,.

No further assumptions are made. In particular, an equation of state,
like p=p( ), is not assumed. The reason for this
will become clear soon.

Note that the vector field () is not
geodesic for the metric () (unlike for the
FLRW and Gautreau metrics), which immediately implies that
the pressure cannot be constant. Being spherically symmetric, is
automatically vorticity free. The last property is manifest from its
hypersurface orthogonality, which is immediate from
(). Moreover, is also shear free.
This, too, can be immediately read off ()
once one takes into account the result that for spherically
symmetric metrics vanishing shear for a spherically symmetric
vector field is equivalent to the corresponding spatial metric
being conformally related to a spherically symmetric flat metric.
This is obviously the case here.

The non-vanishing components of the Einstein tensor with respect to
the orthonormal basis () are:

\,,

2R^2 ( AB )^2

(a \, m)\! I\! \,,

subequations

where an overdot denotes differentiation along
/ t. Before explaining the functions A, B,
R, and F, we make the important observation that the Einstein
tensor is spatially isotropic, where `spatially' refers to the
directions orthogonal to _0. By this we mean that
( _i, _j) _ij or, expressed more
geometrically, that the spatial restriction of the Einstein tensor
is proportional to the spatial restriction of the metric.

In () and in the following we set:

A(t,r) := 1+m(t)/2r \,, B(t,r) := 1-m(t)/2r \,,

and

R(t,r)= ( 1+ m(t)2r )^2 a(t)\,r \,,

where R is the areal radius for the McVittie
ansatz~(), and also

F := aa + 1rB (a\,m)^ a \,.


In passing we note that F has the geometric interpretation of being
one third the expansion of the vector field _0, that is,
F= ( _0)/3. Hence () could also be written
in the form ( _0, _0)=( ( _0))^2/3. We will see later
that the product a\,m which appears in~() also
has a geometric meaning: it is just the Weyl part of the MS energy;
see~().

Now, the non-vanishing components of the energy momentum
tensor~() with~() are:

( _0, _0) = \,,
( _i, _j) = p\, _ij\,.

The ( _0, _1) component of Einstein's equation therefore implies
(a\,m)\! I\! = 0, which means that the Weyl part of
the MS energy is constant. Physically this can be interpreted as
saying that the central object does not accrete any energy from
the ambient matter. Using the constancy of a\,m in~()
we immediately get:

F = aa =: H \,.

Hence Einstein's equation is equivalent to the following three
relations between the four functions m(t), a(t), (t,r),
and p(t,r):

( 1+m/2r1-m/2r ) \,.

Note that here Einstein's equation has only three independent
components (as opposed to four for a general spherically
symmetric metric), which is a consequence of the fact,
already stresses above, that the Einstein tensor for the McVittie
ansatz~() is spatially isotropic.

Equation~() can be immediately integrated:

m(t) = m_0a(t) \,,

where m_0 is an integration constant. Below we will show that this
integration constant is to be interpreted as the mass of the central
body. We will call the metric~() together
with condition~() the McVittie metric.

Clearly the system () is under-determining.
This is expected since no equation of state has yet been imposed.
The reason why we did not impose such a condition can now be easily
inferred from (): whereas ()
implies that only depends on t, ()
implies that p depends on t and r iff ( a/a) 0.
Hence a non-trivial relation p=p( ) is simply incompatible with the
assumptions made so far.
The only possible ways to specify p are p=0 or +p=0.
In the first case () implies that a/a=0
if m_0 0 (since then the second term on the right-hand side is
r dependent, whereas the first is not, so that both must vanish
separately), which corresponds to the exterior Schwarzschild
solution, or a(t) t^2/3 if m_0=0, which leads to the
flat FLRW solution with dust. In the second case the fluid just acts
like a cosmological constant =8 (using the equation
of state +p=0 in =0 it implies p=0 and this,
in turn, using again the equation of state, implies =0) so
that this case reduces to the Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter solution.
To see this explicitly, notice first that
(,) imply the constancy
of H= a/a= /3 and hence one has
a(t)=a_0 (t\, /3 ). With such a scale-factor
the McVittie metric~() with~()
turns into the Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter metric~()
in disguise.
The explicit formulae for the coordinate transformation relating
the two can be found in Section\,5 of~ and also in
Section\,7 of~. Finally, note from
() that constancy of one of the functions m and
a implies constancy of the other. In this case
(,) imply =p=0, so
that we are dealing with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.

A specific McVittie solution can be obtained by choosing a function
a(t), corresponding to the scale function of the FLRW spacetime which
the McVittie model is required to approach at spatial infinity, and the
constant m_0, corresponding to the `central
mass'. Relations~(,),
and~() are then used to determine ,
p, and m, respectively. Clearly this `poor man's way' to solve
Einstein's equation holds the danger of arriving at unrealistic
spacetime dependent relations between and p. This must
be kept in mind when proceeding in this fashion. For further
discussion of this point we refer to~.

Interpretation of the McVittie model

In this section we discuss the interpretation of the McVittie model, its
singularities, trapped regions, symmetry properties, and also the motion
of the matter. In doing this, we shall take care to isolate those properties
which are intrinsic to the ansatz~() independent of
the imposition of Einstein's equation. The analysis can then also be applied
to all generalizations which maintain the ansatz~().
Generalizations in this sense have recently been discussed
in~, on which we will comment at the end
of this section.

According to what has just been said, we wish to regard the McVittie
solution as a candidate model for an isolated mass m_0 in an `otherwise'
flat FLRW universe with scale function a(t). As already emphasized
in the introduction, this requires specific justification in view of
the fact that simple superpositions of solutions are disallowed by the
nonlinearities. A set of criteria for when a solution represents a
localized mass immersed in a flat FLRW background have been proposed
and discussed in detail in~. The basic idea is to
employ the MS energy (in a spherically symmetric context,
where it is equivalent to the Hawking mass) in order to detect
localized sources of gravity. We will follow this approach and for
this purpose we compute the Ricci and the Weyl part of the MS energy.

This we now do for the class of metrics (),
without at first making any use of Einstein's equation. The geometric
definition of the MS energy in terms of the sectional curvature,
together with formula~() for its Ricci part
specialized to metrics with spatially isotropic Einstein tensor,
implies that the Ricci part of the MS energy is given by

E_ R = 16R^3 ( _0, _0)\,.

The Weyl part is then obtained as the difference between the full
MS energy and (). We use the expression
() for the former and write
R R= ( _0(R) )^2- ( _1(R) )^2.
The part involving _0(R) equals (), due to the
relation ( _0, _0)=3( R( _0)/R)^2, which, e.g., follows
from the comment below Eq.~() and ()
(for vanishing shear). The Weyl part of the MS energy is therefore given
by (R/2) (1-( _1(R))^2 ). From ()
we calculate _1(R) and hence obtain for the Weyl part of the MS energy:

E_ W = a\,m\,.

Now we invoke Einstein's equation with source~()
and four-velocity (). Then the Ricci and Weyl
contributions to the MS energy can be written in the following form,
also taking into account~(),

subequations
alignat3
&E_ R &&= 4 3R^3 \,,

&E_ W &&= m_0 \,.

Identifying the gravitational mass of the central object with the Weyl
part of the MS energy, its constancy means that no energy is accreted
from the ambient matter. As regards the Ricci part, note that the
factor (4 /3) R^3 in~() is smaller than
the proper geometric volume within the sphere of areal radius R.
This can be attributed to the gravitational binding energy that
diminishes the gravitational mass of a lump of matter below the value
given by the proper space integral of ( _0, _0). This is shown
in more detail in Appendix~, in particular
in the exact equation~() and its leading order
approximation~().

It is also important to note that the central gravitational mass in
McVittie's spacetime may be modeled by a shear-free perfect-fluid star
of positive homogeneous energy density~. The matching
is performed along a world-tube comoving with the cosmological fluid,
across which the energy density jumps discontinuously. This means that
the star's surface is comoving with the cosmological fluid and hence,
in view of~(), that it geometrically expands
(or contracts). This feature, however, should be merely seen as an artifact
of the McVittie model (in which the relation~()
holds), rather than a general property of compact objects in any cosmological
spacetimes. Positive pressure within the star seems to be only possible if
2a a+ a^2<0 (see Eq.~(3.27) in~ with
a= ( /2)), that is, for deceleration parameters q>1/2.

Next we comment on the singularity properties of the McVittie model.
From~() it is clear that, unless a/a is
constant (the Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter case) or m=0 (FLRW case), the
pressure diverges at r=m/2 (that is at R=2m_0=R_S). In fact, this
corresponds to a genuine curvature singularity which is built into
the McVittie ansatz~() independently of
any further assumption. To see that r=m/2 (corresponding to
R=2am=2E_ W) is a singularity it suffices to consider the
scalar curvature (i.e.~the Ricci scalar) of~(),

= - 12F^2 - 6 AB F \,,

which is readily computed from~().
In~ we show that this becomes singular in the
limit r m/2, with the only exceptions being the following three
special cases:
(i)~m=0 and a arbitrary (FLRW spacetimes),
(ii)~a and m constant (Schwarzschild spacetime), and
(iii)~(a\,m)^ =0 and ( a/a)^ =0
(Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetime).
This means that, as long as we stick to the
ansatz~(), at r=m/2 there will always (with the
only exceptions listed above) be a singularity in the Ricci part of the
curvature and thus, assuming Einstein's equation is satisfied, also in
the energy momentum tensor, irrespectively of the details of its underlying
matter model. Hence any attempt to eliminate this singularity by
maintaining the ansatz~() and merely modifying
the matter model is doomed to fail. In particular, this is true for the
generalizations presented in , contrary to
what is claimed in that work. We also remark that it makes no sense to
absorb the singular factors 1/B in front of the time derivatives by
writing (A/B) / t as _0 and then argue, as was
done in , that this eliminates the singularity.
The point is simply that then e_0 applied to any continuously
differentiable function diverges as r m/2.
Below we will show that this singularity lies within a trapped region.
Turning back to the McVittie model, recall that in this case it is assumed
that the fluid moves along the integral curves of / t,
which become lightlike in the limit as r tends to m/2. Their acceleration
is given by the gradient of the pressure, which necessarily diverges in the
limit r m/2, as one explicitly sees
from~(). For a more detailed study of the geometric
singularity at r=m/2, see~.

For spherically symmetric spacetimes the Weyl part of the curvature has
only a single independent component (see~())
which, by its very definition, is -2/R^3 times the Weyl part of the
MS energy (see~()). The square of the Weyl tensor
for the ansatz () may then be conveniently expressed
as (see~() and~())

= 48 (a\,m)^2R^6 \,.

This shows that R=0 also corresponds to a genuine curvature singularity,
though this is not part of the region covered by our original coordinate
system, for which r>m/2 (that is R>2E_ W).

It is instructive to also determine the trapped regions of McVittie
spacetime. We do this just using the McVittie ansatz~()
and making no further assumptions. Recall that a spacelike two-sphere S
is said to be trapped, marginally trapped, or untrapped if
the product ^+ ^- of the expansions (defined below
Eq.~()) for the ingoing and outgoing future-pointing
null vector fields normal to S is positive, zero, or negative. Taking
S to be S_R, that is, a sphere of symmetry with areal radius R, it
immediately follows from~() that S_R is
trapped, marginally trapped, or untrapped iff R R is
positive, zero, or negative, respectively. This corresponds to timelike,
lightlike, or spacelike R, or, equivalently, in in view
of~(), to 2E-R being positive, zero, or negative,
respectively. Using~() together
with~(), the MS energy for the McVittie ansatz can
be written as E = E_ W + R^3F^2/2, so that

2E - R = F^2R^3 - R + R_S \,,

where R_S\!:=\!2E_ W denotes the `generalized' Schwarzschild radius.
Note that in general F depends itself on the radial coordinate---except
for the McVittie case, in which one has F=H=:1/R_H (R_H denotes the
Hubble radius). For computational simplicity we specialize in the following
to the McVittie case, referring to for the
general case. Doing this, () becomes a cubic
polynomial in R which is positive for R=0 and tends to for
R . Hence it always has a negative zero (which does
not interest us) and two positive zeros iff

R_S/R_H < 2/3 3 0.38 \,.

This clearly corresponds to the physical relevant case where the
Schwarzschild radius is much smaller than the Hubble radius. One zero lies
in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild radius and one in the vicinity of the
Hubble radius, corresponding to two marginally trapped spheres. The exact
expressions for the zeros can be easily written down, but are not very
illuminating. In leading order in the small parameter R_S/R_H, they are
approximated by

subequations

&R_1 R_S ( 1 + (R_S/R_H)^2 )\,,

&R_2 R_H ( 1 - R_S/2R_H ) \,.

subequations

From this one sees that for the McVittie model the radius of the marginally
trapped sphere of Schwarzschild spacetime (R_S) increases and that of the
FLRW spacetime (R_H) decreases. The first feature can be understood as an
effect of the presence of cosmological matter, whereas the latter is an
effect of the presence of a central mass abundance.
All the spheres with R<R_1 or R>R_2 are trapped and those with
R_1<R<R_2 are untrapped. In particular, the singularity r=m/2, that is
R=2E_ W=R_S, lies within the inner trapped region.

Another aspect concerns the global behavior of the McVittie
ansatz~(). We note that each hypersurface of constant
time t is a complete Riemannian manifold, which, besides the rotational
symmetry, admits a discrete isometry given in (r, , )
coordinates by

(r, , ) =
((m/2)^2\,r^-1\,,\, \,,\, )\,.


This corresponds to an inversion at the two-sphere r=m/2 and shows that
the hypersurfaces of constant t can be thought of as two isometric
asymptotically-flat pieces joined together at the totally geodesic (being
a fixed-point set of an isometry and hence also minimal) two-sphere r=m/2.
Except for the time-dependent factor m(t), this is analogous to the
geometry of the t=const. slices in the Schwarzschild metric
(the difference being that () does not extend to
an isometry of the spacetime metric unless m=0). This means, in
particular, that the McVittie metric cannot literally be interpreted as
corresponding to a point particle sitting at r=0 (r=0 is at infinite
metric distance) in a flat FLRW universe, just like the Schwarzschild metric
does not correspond to a point particle sitting at r=0 in Minkowski space.
Unfortunately, McVittie seems to have interpreted his solution in this
fashion~ which even until recently gave rise to some
confusion in the literature
(e.g.~).
A clarification was given by~.

We now briefly discuss the basic properties of the motion of cosmological
matter for the McVittie model. We already mentioned that the vorticity and
shear of the four-velocity vanish identically. On the other hand, the
expansion (divergence of ) is

= 3 H\,,

just as in the FLRW case (recall that here H:= a/a is defined as in
the FLRW case, see~()). In particular, the
expansion of the cosmological fluid is homogeneous in space.
The expression for the variation of the areal radius along the
integral lines of (that is the velocity of cosmological
matter measured in terms of its proper time and the areal
radius) is also just as in the FLRW case:

(R) = HR \,,

which is nothing but Hubble's law. The acceleration of , which in
contrast to the FLRW case does not vanish, is given by

_ = m_0R^2 ( 1+m/2r1-m/2r ) _1\,.

In leading order in m_0/R this corresponds to the acceleration of the
observers moving along / T in Schwarzschild spacetime
(see Eq.~() with =0).

We conclude this subsection by commenting on the attempts to generalize the
McVittie model. The first obvious generalization consists in allowing a
non-vanishing cosmological constant. This is however trivial, since it is
equivalent to the substitution + _ and
p p+p_ in~(), where
_ := /8 and p_ :=- /8 are,
respectively, the energy-density and pressure associated to the cosmological
constant .
In , attempts to generalize the McVittie model
have focused on keeping the ansatz~() and relaxing
the conditions on the matter in various ways. More precisely, they show that
the McVittie case may be generalized to allow for radial fluid motions
relative to the _0 observer field (that is relaxing
condition~()), provided one also allows for a
non-vanishing radial heat flow. Both energy flows are necessary in order to
get new solutions consistent with the ansatz~(),
even though the two radial energy flows do not cancel in the energy balance.
As a result, the Weyl part of the MS energy will now change in time so that
the new solutions correspond to inhomogeneities of variable strength due to
accretion or loss of energy. For further analysis of these solutions we refer
to~. Another generalization of the McVittie model,
this time away from the ansatz (), is given in
. It is constructed by applying
a particular (time-dependent) conformal transformation to the Schwarzschild
spacetime. As we will show in~, the metric so
obtained cannot be written in the McVittie form~(),
contrary to what is suggested in~.
The corresponding energy-momentum tensor (obtained via Einstein's
equation) can be interpreted as a sum of two contributions, one due to a
perfect fluid and the other to a null fluid.

Motion of a test particle in McVittie spacetime

We are interested in the motion of a test particle (idealizing a
planet or a spacecraft) in McVittie's spacetime. In
it was concluded within a slow-motion and weak-field approximation
that Keplerian orbits do not expand as measured with the `cosmological
geodesic radius' r_*=a(t)r. Later~ and
argued for the presence of the
acceleration term~() proportional to
a/a within this approximation scheme, hence arriving
at~(). In the following we shall show how to
arrive at () from the exact geodesic equation of the
McVittie metric by making clear the approximations involved.
Related recent discussions were given in~,
where the effects of cosmological expansion on the periastron
precession and eccentricity are discussed for constant Hubble
parameter H:= a/a.

We will again work with the areal radius R. Note that for
fixed t the map r R(t,r) is 2-to-1 and that R 2m_0,
where R=2m_0 corresponds to r=m_0/2a. Hence we restrict the
coordinate transformation () to the
region r> m_0/2a where it becomes a diffeomorphism onto the
region R> 2m_0. (The region R<2m_0 was investigated in
.) Reintroducing factors of c, McVittie's
metric assumes the (non-diagonal) form in the region R>2m_0
(i.e.~r>m_0/2a(t))

split
=& ( 1 - 2 (R) - h(t,R)^2 )c^2 t^2
& + 2h(t,R) 1-2 (R) c\, t\, R- dR^21-2 (R)
- R^2 \,,
split

where we put

(R) := m_0R \,, h(t,R) := H(t)Rc

with H(t):= ( a/a)(t), as usual.

The equations for a timelike geodesic (i.e.~parametrized with respect
to proper time), z^ ( ) with g( z, z)=c^2,
follows via variational principle from the Lagrangian
L(z, z)=(1/2)g_ (z) z^ z^ .
Spherical symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum.
Hence we may choose the particle's orbit to lie in the
equatorial plane = /2. The constant modulus of angular
momentum is

R^2 = L \,.

The remaining two equations are then coupled second-order ODEs for
t( ) and R( ). However, we may replace the first one by its
first integral that results from ( , )=c^2:

split
& ( 1 - 2 (R) - h^2(t,R) )c^2 t^2
&+ 2h(t,R) 1-2 (R) c\, t\, R
- R^21-2 (R)
- (L/R)^2 =c^2\,.
split

The remaining radial equation is given by

split
R \;
&- ( 1-2 (R)-h^2(t,R) ) L^2R^3

&+ m_0\,c^2R^2 ( 1-2 (R) )\, t^2

&-R ( H(t)\, (1-2 (R) )^1/2

& -R (\;+H(t)^2 ( 1- (R)-h^2(t,R) )
)\, t^2

&- ( (R)-h^2(t,R) )
1-2 (R)\, RR^2

&+ 2 ( (R)- h^2(t,R) )
1-2 (R)\, c\,H(t)\,( R/c)\, t \;\; = \; 0 \,.
split

Recall that m_0=GM/c^2, where M is the mass of the central star in
standard units.

Equations~(,) are exact.
We are interested in orbits of slow-motion (compared with the speed
of light) in the region where

R_S R R_H \,.

Recall that R_S and R_H are the Schwarzschild and the Hubble
radius, respectively
(see~(),()).
The latter condition clearly covers all situations of practical
applicability in the Solar System, since the Schwarzschild radius
R_S of the Sun is about 3~km =2 10^-8AU and the Hubble
radius R_H is about 13.7 10^9\,ly = 8.7 10^14\,AU.

The approximation now consists in considering small perturbations of
Keplerian orbits. Let T be a typical time scale of the problem, like
the period for closed orbits or else R/v with v a typical velocity.
The expansion is then with respect to the following two parameters:

subequations

_ 1
\, vc
( m_0R )^ 12\,,

corresponding to a slow-motion and weak-field approximation, and

_ 2 \, HT\,,

subequations

corresponding to the approximation for small ratios of characteristic-times
to the age of the universe. In order to make the expression to be
approximated dimensionless, we multiply () by
1/c^2 and () by T^2/R. Then we expand the right
hand sides in powers of the parameters (), using
the fact that h:=(HR/c) _ 1 _ 2.
From this and () we obtain () if we
keep only terms to zero-order in _ 1 and leading
(i.e.~quadratic) order in _ 2, where we also
re-express R as function of t. Note that in this approximation
the areal radius R is equal to the spatial geodesic distance on
the t=const. hypersurfaces.

We already mentioned that in the special case of constant H= a/a
the McVittie solution turns into the Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter
metric~(), which also describes the spacetime
inside the Einstein--Straus vacuoles in case of non-vanishing
cosmological constant. Recently, exact expressions in terms of
hyper-elliptic integrals for the integrated geodesic equation in
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetimes where derived
in~.
Moreover, a general discussion of Solar-System effects in
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter, like gravitational redshift, light
deflection, time delay, perihelion precession, geodetic precession,
and effects on Doppler tracking, has been given
in~. For example, it was found
that a non-vanishing could account for the anomalous Pioneer
acceleration if its value was -10^-37\,m^-2,
which is minus 10^15 times the current most probable
value. That value would also give rise to a perihelion precession
four orders of magnitude larger than the accuracy to which this effect
has been measured today.

We conclude by commenting on the geodesic equation in the generalizations
of McVittie's model given in~ and
in~. An essential feature which distinguish
these solutions from the McVittie one, is that in the former the
Weyl part of the MS energy E_ W=a\,m is not a constant as for McVittie
but varies in time, meaning that there is an accretion of cosmological
matter by the inhomogeneity (see~).
In view of the fact that the combination

m/r = A^2E_ W/R E_ W/R

contained in the McVittie ansatz gives (minus) the `Newtonian' part of the
potential in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation (see
Section~), we deduce that in order to get
the geodesic equation for the generalized McVittie models it suffices
to substitute m_0 with E_ W in the equation of motion derived in
Section~. This means that the strength of the
central attraction varies in time, leading to an in- or out-spiraling of
the orbits if E_ W is increasing or decreasing, respectively.

Exact condition for non-expanding circular orbits in McVittie spacetime

Analogously to Section~, where we ask whether
there exist non-expanding circular orbits (i.e.~of constant areal radius)
of the electron-proton system in a FLRW spacetime, we now ask whether there
exist non-expanding circular orbits of an (uncharged) test particle around
the central mass. The necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen
follows from inserting R= const in the radial part of the geodesic
equation~() and using the normalization
condition~() of the four-velocity in order to eliminate
t. In terms of the dimensionless quantities h(t):=RH(t)/c,
l:=L/Rc, and :=m_0/R, the condition for the existence of non-expanding
circular orbits can be given the following form:

Rc h =
( 1-2 -h^2 ) ( (1+3l^2)-l^2-h^2 )
(1+l^2) 1-2 \,.

As for the electron-proton system in an FLRW spacetime
(see~()) this is a first-order autonomous
ODE for h(t) and therefore the Hubble function. In the present case
the ODE is even simpler since it has the elementary form
h=p(h^2), where p is a polynomial of degree two with
constant coefficients. From~(),
to leading order in the small quantities , l^2, and h^2,
we get the same approximate ODE~() and hence
the same approximate solutions~().
Hence, the same conclusions as drawn for the electron-proton system
in FLRW apply here.

From~() it follows that stationary
solutions h(t)= const=:h_0, corresponding to an exponentially-
growing scale factor~() (and hence leading
to a Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetime), are those where h_0 satisfies

l^2+h_0^2(1+3l^2) = \,,

where we used that the first factor on the numerator of the right-hand side
of () is nonzero, as can be immediately
inferred from the normalization condition~().
Notice that for a vanishing Hubble parameter (that is for h_0=0) the above
condition reduces to the third Kepler law in Schwarzschild spacetime, as
expected. The effect of a non-vanishing Hubble parameter is again that we
must provide the orbiting particle with a smaller angular velocity
(smaller l) in order to keep it on a non-expanding circular orbit with the
same radius. The largest radius at which in a McVittie spacetime
with exponentially-expanding scale factor (that is a
Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetime) there is a non-expanding circular
orbit follows from~() in
the limit l 0. Then the condition reduces to h_0^2=
which, solving for R, gives (R_S R_H^2/2)^1/3. This, exactly
corresponds to the critical radius~(), taking into
account that q_0=-1 for an exponentially-growing scale factor.

Kinematical effects

In this section we discuss the influence of cosmic expansion
upon measurements of relative distances, velocities, and
accelerations. These kinematical notions loose their a\,priori
meaning in general spacetimes, in particular in time-dependent
ones. Hence it is of utmost importance to carefully reconsider
statements concerning such notions and their precise relations
to locally observable quantities.

Einstein- versus cosmological simultaneity

Misidentifications in the notion of simultaneity can give rise to
apparent anomalies in velocities and acceleration. Such an effect
has e.g.~been suggested in and
again in to be able to account for the PA.
Their argument says that in a spatially flat FLRW universe the
mismatch between adapted cosmological coordinates on the one hand
and radar coordinates on the other just amount to an apparent
difference in radial acceleration of magnitude ().
We agree on the existence and conceptual importance of such an effect
but we disagree on the magnitude, which seems to have been grossly
overestimated as we will show below.

The cause of such effects lies in the way one actually measures
spatial distances and determines the clock readings they are
functions of (a trajectory is a `distance' for each given `time').
The point is this: equations of motions give us, for example,
simultaneous (with respect to cosmological time) spatial geodesic
distances as functions of cosmological time. This is what we implicitly
did in the Newtonian analysis. But, in fact, spacecraft ranging is done
by exchanging electromagnetic signals. The notions of spatial distance
and simultaneity thereby implicitly used are not the same as
those we referred to above. Hence the analytical expression of the
`trajectory' so measured will be different.

We first recall the local version of Einstein simultaneity in
general spacetimes ( , ). We take ds=g_ dx^ dx^
to carry the unit of length so that d =ds/c carries the
unit of time. In general coordinates \x^ \=\t,x^i\, where x^0=t
denotes the timelike coordinate, the metric reads

ds^2 = g_ dx^ \,dx^
= g_ttdt^2 + 2g_tidt\,dx^i + g_ijdx^i\,dx^j\,.

The observer at fixed spatial coordinates is given by the vector
field (normalized to ( , )=c^2)


= c\, / t^-1 / t
= c g_tt / t \,.

Consider the light cone with vertex p ; one has ds^2=0, which
allows to solve for dt in terms of the dx^i (all functions g_
are evaluated at p, unless noted otherwise):

dt_1,2 = -\, g_tig_tt\,dx^i
( g_tig_tjg^2_tt- g_ijg_tt )
dx^i\,dx^j\,.

The plus sign corresponds to the future light-cone at p,
the negative sign to the past light cone. An integral line of
in a neighborhood of p cuts the light cone in two points,
q_+ and q_-. If t_p is the time assigned to p, then
t_q_+=t_p+dt_1 and t_q_-=t_p+dt_2. The coordinate-time
separation between these two cuts is t_q_+-t_q_-=dt_1-dt_2,
corresponding to a proper time g_tt(dt_1-dt_2)/c for
the observer . This observer will associate
a radar-distance dl_* to the event p of c/2 times that
proper time interval, that is:

dl_*^2 = h =
( g_tig_tjg_tt - g_ij ) dx^i\,dx^j\,.

The event on the integral line of that the observer will
call Einstein-synchronous with p lies in the middle between
q_+ and q_-. Its time coordinate is in first-order approximation
given by 12(t_q_++t_q_-)=t_p+ 12(dt_1+dt_2)=t_p+dt,
where

dt := 12(dt_1+dt_2) = - g_tig_tt\,dx^i\,.

This means the following: The integral lines of are parametrized
by the spatial coordinates \x^i\_i=1,2,3. Given a point p,
specified by the orbit-coordinates x^i_p and the time-coordinate
t_p, we consider a neighboring orbit of
with orbit-coordinates x^i_p+dx^i. The event on the latter which
is Einstein synchronous with p has a time coordinate t_p+dt, where
dt is given by (), or equivalently

:= dt+ g_tig_tt\,dx^i = 0\,.

Using a differential geometric language we may say that
Einstein simultaneity defines a distribution =0.

The metric () can be written in terms of the
radar-distance metric h () and the simultaneity
1-form as follows:

ds^2 = g_ dx^ \,dx^ = g_tt\, ^2-h\,,

showing that the radar-distance is just the same as the
Einstein-simultaneous distance. A curve in intersects
the flow lines of perpendicularly iff ( )=0,
which is just the condition that neighboring clocks along
are Einstein synchronized.

We now apply the foregoing to isotropic cosmological metrics.
In what follows we drop for simplicity the angular dimensions.
Hence we consider metrics of the form

ds^2 = c^2dt^2 - a(t)^2dr^2\,.

The comoving observer field,

= c\, / t \,,


is geodesic and of expansion 3H. On a hypersurface of constant t
the radial geodesic distance is given by a(t)r. Making this distance
into a spatial coordinate, r_*, we consider the coordinate transformation

t t_*:=t\,,
r r_*:=a(t)r\,.

The field / t_* is given by

/ t_* =
/ t - Hr\, / r\,,

to which the observer field,

_* := c\, / t_*^-1\, / t_*

corresponds. In contrast to (), whose flow connects
comoving points of constant coordinate r, the flow of
() connects points of constant geodesic distances,
as measured in the surfaces of constant cosmological time. This could
be called cosmologically instantaneous geodesic distance.
It is now very important to realize that this notion of distance is not the
same as the radar distance that one determines by exchanging light signals
in the usual (Einsteinian) way. Let us explain this in detail:

From () we have adr=dr_*-r_*Hdt, where
H:= a/a (Hubble parameter). Rewriting the metric
() in terms of t_* and r_* yields

alignat1
ds^2
&\ =\ c^2(1-(Hr_*/c)^2)\,dt_*^2-dr_*^2+2Hr_*\,dt\,dr_*

& -\ dr_*^21-(Hr_*/c)^2_ h\,.

Hence the differentials of radar-distance and time-lapse for
Einstein-simultaneity are given by

& dl_*&&\,=\, dr_* 1-(Hr_*/c)^2\,,

& dt_*&&\,=\,-\, Hr_*/c^21-(Hr_*/c)^2dr_*\,.

Let the distinguished observer (us on earth) now move along the
geodesic r_*=0. Integration of () from r_*=0
to some value r_* then gives the radar distance l_* as well as
the time lapse t_* as functions of the cosmologically
simultaneous geodesic distance r_*:

& &&\,=\, (r_*/c) \- 12(Hr_*/c)

Combining both equations in () allows to
express the time-lapse in terms of the radar-distance:

split
t_* &=H^-1\, ( (H\,l_*/c) )
&=(l_*/c) \- 12(Hl_*/c) + ((Hl_*/c)^2 ) \\,.
split

Now, suppose a satellite S moves on a worldline r_*(t_*)
in the neighborhood of our worldline r_*=0. Assume that we measure
the distance to the satellite by radar coordinates. Then instead of
the value r_* we would use l_* and instead of the argument t_*
we would assign the time t_*- t_* which corresponds to the
value of cosmological time at that event on our worldline that is
Einstein synchronous to the event (t_*,r_*); see Fig.~.

Hence we have

where () is () to leading
order and all quantities are evaluated at t_*. We set v= r_*.

To see what this entails we Taylor expand in t_* around t_*=0
(just a convenient choice):


r_*(t_*) = r_0+v_0t_*+ 12a_0t_*^ 2 +

and insert in (). This leads to


l_*(t_*) = r_0+ v_0t_*+ 12 a_0t_*^ 2 + \,,

These are, in quadratic approximation, the sought-after relations
between the quantities measured via radar tracking (tilded) and the
quantities which arise in the (improved) Newtonian equations of motion
(not tilded).

In particular, the last equation () shows that
there is an apparent inward pointing acceleration, given by Hc times the
(v/c)^3+ term in curly brackets. As discussed in the introduction,
Hc is indeed of the same order of magnitude as the PA, as was much
emphasized in .
However, in contrast to these authors, we also get the additional
term in curly brackets, which in case of the Pioneer spacecraft suppresses
the Hc term by 13 orders of magnitude!
Our Eq.~() corresponds to Eq.~(10) of
. From it the authors of
and
immediately jump to the conclusion that there is ``an effective
residual acceleration directed toward the center of coordinates;
its constant value is Hc''. We were unable to follow this
conclusion. Likewise, we are unable to follow the conclusion in
. Hence we conclude that, with respect to the
PA, there is no significant kinematical effect resulting from the distinct
simultaneity structures inherent in radar and cosmological coordinates.

Doppler tracking in cosmological spacetimes

Doppler Tracking is a common method of tracking the position of
vehicles in space. It involves measuring the Doppler shift of
an electromagnetic signal sent from a spacecraft to a tracking
station on Earth. This signal is either coming from an on-board
oscillator or is coherently transponded by the vehicle in
response to a signal received from the ground station. Here we
focus on the second of these modes, which is more useful for
navigation, partly because the returning signal is measured
against the same frequency reference as that of the originally
transmitted signal and partly because the Earth-based frequency
reference is also more stable than the oscillator on-board
the spacecraft.

Minkowski spacetime

It is clear that this method will be fundamentally influenced
if performed within a time varying background geometry.
Before elaborating on this, we consider the simple case of
static Minkowski space.

In Fig.~ we depicted two worldlines, one of the
observer (straight vertically) and one for the space vehicle. A light
signal is emitted by the observer at the event p_0, reflected by the
vehicle at event p_1, and finally received back by the observer at event
p_2. We choose a global Minkowski frame, that is global coordinates
\x^ \=\t,x^i\ with
( / x^ , / x^ )= (1,-1,-1,-1),
in which the observer (for simplicity assumed to be inertial) is at rest at
the origin of the spatial coordinates. If :=v/c denotes the
radial velocity of the vehicle in units of c, the well known
special-relativistic Doppler formula (applied twice) says that
the ratio between the received and the emitted
frequencies is
Note that in Special Relativity the Doppler Formula does, of course,
not distinguish between moving emitter and moving receiver.
So () is obtained by squaring the frequency
shift (1- )/(1+ ), which is picked up once for the
ratio _R(t_R)/ _1(t_1) (receiver moving relative to the
Minkowski frame) and once for _2(t_2)/ _1(t_1) (emitter
moving relative to Minkowski frame). Incidentally, exactly the same
formula would result in non-relativistic physics if the observer is
taken to be at rest with respect to the wave-guiding medium (e.g.,
the ether), which distinguishes the two states of relative motion.
Indeed, in this case we have _1(t_1)/ _0(t_0)=(1- (t_1))
and _2(t_2)/ _1(t_1)=1/(1- (t_1)), whose product
is again just ().

_2(t_2) _0(t_0)
= 1- (t_1)1+ (t_1)\,.

Here t_0,t_1, and t_2 refer to the global Minkowski time attributed to
p_0,p_1, and p_2, respectively. In Doppler tracking
one is interested in the derivative of this ratio with respect to t_2,
which yields a measure for the velocity of the spacecraft. We assume
_0 to be constant in time and note that, given the worldlines
of the observer and the vehicle, t_1 and t_0 are uniquely determined
by t_2 (since the events p_1 and p_0 are determined by p_2).
If r denotes the spatial radius coordinate we have
t_2-t_1=r(t_1)/c. Differentiation with respect to t_1 leads to

dt_1dt_2= 11+ (t_1)

and hence

split
-\, 12\, _2(t_2) _0(t_0)
& = (t_1)\, (1+ (t_1) )^-3
& = (t_1)\, (1-3 (t_1) + ( ^2) )\,.
split

This shows that - _2/2 _0, namely (minus one-half) the
derivative of the received to emitted frequency ratio with respect to the
proper time of the receiving observer, gives the spacecraft's spatial
acceleration up to corrections of order . Note that in
view of note~ it would be inappropriate to call these
corrections `special relativistic'.

The final goal of this section is to derive the generalization
of~() for a cosmological spacetime.
For this we need two things: First, we need to know what is the
generalization of the concepts of spatial velocity and spatial acceleration
in an arbitrary spacetime and, second, we need to know how electromagnetic
signals propagate in an arbitrary spacetime. This is taken care of in the
next paragraph.

General setting

In order to generalize the notions of spatial velocity and spatial
acceleration to arbitrary spacetime one needs to introduce a
fiducial reference `observer-field'; compare, e.g.,~
and also ).
An observer at the event p is a future pointing unit timelike
vector in the tangent space T_p( ) of at p. An observer field
is a field of future pointing unit timelike vectors. Any observer
at p gives rise to an orthogonal split of the tangent space T_p( )
at p in a part parallel to (the local time-axis) and a part orthogonal
to it (the local rest space). Since is not lightlike the two
orthogonal subspaces are complementary, that is, together they span the
whole tangent space and intersect only in the zero vector.
The orthogonal projections of an arbitrary vector T_p( )
onto these subspaces are, respectively, given by

subequations

& _ ( )&&:= ( , ) \,,

& _ ( )&&:= - ( , ) \,,

which imply the decomposition identity = _ ( )+ _ ( ).

If two observers and are defined at the same point,

the spatial velocity (over~c) of with respect to
is given by

_ ( )
:= _ ( ) _ ( )
= - ( , ) ( , ) \,,

which is an element of the local rest space _ T( ). Its modulus
is given by

_ ( )
:= _ ( )
= 1-1/ ( , )^2\,.

Note that for the modulus we have _ ( )= _ ( ), though
the vectors _ ( ) and _ ( ) are linearly independent
as they lie in _uT( ) and _v T( ), respectively. Note also that
( , )=1/ 1- _ ^2( ) is just the ordinary
`gamma-factor'. Finally, if _ T( ) is a unit vector, we define
the spatial velocity of in direction w.r.t.~ by

^ _ ( )
= - ( , _ ( ))= -\, ( , ) ( , )\,.

The spatial acceleration of a worldline w.r.t.~a given
observer field is defined as the rate of change of the spatial velocity
_ ( ) within the local rest spaces _ T( ) of
and with respect to the clocks moving along . Denoting this
acceleration (divided by c) with , we have

_ ( ):= ^ _ _ ( ) \,,

where we used the following covariant derivative for _ T( )-valued
vector fields along :

^ _ := _ ^-1\
_ _ _ \,.

Here _ denotes the ordinary (Levi-Civita)
covariant derivative along . As an application one can, for example,
rewrite the geodesic equation, _ =0, for a
worldline in terms of the spatial quantities just introduced.
One gets (see~ or, in a slightly different
notation,~):

_ = - _ _ [ _ +
_ ( _ ) + _ ( _ ) ] \,,

where for better readability we omitted the arguments and
in the spatial acceleration and spatial velocity.
Here _ := _ is the four-acceleration of the observer
field , _ and _ are, respectively, its
shear-expansion and rotation tensors of rank (1,1) (endomorphism),
and _ _ := _ + _ _ is a
rank (1,1) tensor which, in a slow-motion approximation (neglecting
quadratic and higher terms in ), reduces to the identity on the
local rest space of .
Equation~() should be seen as a local version of
Newton's equation. For example, in Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter
spacetime~(), taking to be proportional to
the timelike Killing field / T, one has
_ = _ =0 (because of the Killing equation and spherical
symmetry, respectively) and

_ = _ = 1 V
( mR^2- 3 R ) _R\,,

where _R denotes the
the normalized radial vector field / R (we use here
the coordinates and the notation of~()). Hence, in
slow-motion and weak-field approximation (that is keeping only linear
terms in , m/R, and R^2), the geodesic equation of
motion in the form~() reduces to

_ ( - mR^2+ 3R ) _R\,,

which just gives the `improved' Newtonian equation for geodesic motions
in Schwarzschild--de\,Sitter spacetime. It has the same form as the
improved Newtonian equation studied in Section~.

We turn now to electromagnetic signals and restrict our attention to
monochromatic waves in the geometric-optics approximation (i.e.~for
wave-lengths negligibly small w.r.t.~a typical radius of curvature of the
spacetime and w.r.t.~a typical length over which amplitude, polarization,
and frequency vary). In this approximation an electromagnetic signal
propagates on a lightlike geodesic along which the wave-vector, ,
is tangent, future-pointing, and parallelly transported. Recall that
is so normalized that the frequency measured by an
observer, say , is

_ ( ):= ( , )\,.

Given a wave-vector and two observers , at the same spacetime
point, their observed frequencies are thus _ ( )= ( , )
and _ ( )= ( , ), and their ratio is given by

_ ( ) _ ( )=
( _ + _ , ) ( , )=
g( , ) [ 1- ^ _ ( ) ]\,.

Here the spacelike unit vector := _ ( )^-1 _ ( )
defines the direction of in the local rest space of . In deriving
() we used ()
and _ ( )= ( , ) to write
( , _ ( )) = - ( , ) ( , ) ^ _ ( ).
Equation~() is the general form of the
Doppler formula.

Let now be an observer field along one integral line
of which the distinguished observer is moving. The worldline of the
vehicle is denoted by . The domain of the field is
assumed to include a neighborhood of . The wave-vector
_0 emitted at p_0 suffers three changes:

compactenum
propagation from p_0 to p_1: _0 _1;
reflection at p_1: _1 '_1;
propagation from p_1 to p_2: '_1 _2.
compactenum

We are interested in the ratio of the received to the emitted
frequency:

_2 _0
= ( _2, _2) ( _0, _0)
= ( _2 '_1 )
( '_1 _1 )
( _1 _0 )\,.

What happens at reflection (the second process: _1 '_1)?
Well, with respect to the spacecraft moving along with
four-velocity = , the wave vector _1 at p_1
splits according to

_1 = _ ( _1)+ _ ( _1)\,.

A corner-cube reflector transported along will
reverse _ ( _1) while keeping _ ( _1)
intact (here we neglect a possible transponder shift which is
irrelevant for our discussion):

_1 '_1
= _ ( _1)- _ ( _1)
= 2 _ ( _1)- _1\,.

Hence _1:= _ ( _1)= ( _1, _1) and
'_1:= _ ( '_1)= ( _1, '_1),
the in- and out-going frequencies measured by the observer
at p_1, are related by

'_1 _1
= 2\ ( , ) ( , ) _p_1
( , ) _p_1-1
= 2\ 1- ^ _ ( ) _p_1
1- ^2_u( ) _p_1-1 \,,

where in the last step we just used~()
to rewrite the ratio ( , )/ ( , ). This accounts
for the middle ratio on the right-hand side of~().

To account for the other two ratios in~(), one
uses the laws of geometric optics in (curved) spacetime to relate
_0= ( _0, _0) (at p_0) and _2= ( _2, _2)
(at p_2) to kinematical quantities of at p_1.
In general spacetimes without timelike conformal
Killing fields these quotients will also explicitly
depend on time. For example, if is a Killing field
(like = / t in Special Relativity), we have
( _0, _0)= ( _1, _1) and ( _2, _2)= ( _1, '_1),
so that

_2 _0
=2\ 1- _ ^ ( ) _p_1
1- ^2_ ( ) _p_1 - 1 \,.

As a trivial application, this includes the generalized form
of (), the latter corresponding
to purely radial motion.

FLRW spacetimes

In standard cosmological spacetimes (FLRW), = / t is
not Killing, though =a(t) / t is conformally Killing
(L_ = 2 a ).
One now has a_0 ( _0, _0)=a_1 ( _1, _1) and
a_2 ( _2, _2)=a_1 ( _1, '_1), so that instead of
() one gets

_2 _0
= a_0a_2\
\2\ 1- _u^ k( ) _p_1
1- ^2_u( ) _p_1-1 \ \,.

We now want to relate the t_2-derivative of
() to the acceleration of
.
In order to calculate the derivative _2(t_2)/ _0(t_0)
we need to know the derivatives dt_1/dt_2 and dt_0/dt_2.
Restricting to the flat FLRW case for simplicity, they follow from
the law of null propagation:

&&\,=\, 1c \

The exact formula for the t_2--derivative of the frequency-shift rate
can now be computed. One obtains

where we suppressed the argument and index at
for better readability. This formula provides an exact relation between
the time derivative of the observable frequency shift (defined `here')
and the kinematical quantities of the vehicle (defined `there'), provided
the scale function a(t) is known. For purely radial motion
^u_ =0 and we obtain the simpler expression
(now writing for~ ^ )

In order to consistently approximate this expression in terms of small
quantities and H t, where t:=(t_2-t_0)/2, we
think of () as being multiplied with
t and regard t as being of order .
Then, keeping only quadratic terms in , linear terms in
H t where t:=(t_2-t_0)/2, and also mixed terms
H t, we get

-\, 12\, _2(t_2) _0(t_0)
(1-3 -3H t )+H \,.

Hence we see that in this approximation there are two
modifications, besides the -3 -term already familiar
from (), due to cosmic
expansion: First, there is an additional contribution
-3H t acting in the same way as the -3 -term.
It can also be interpreted in the same fashion, as its
corresponds to the velocity (over c) of H t
that a comoving systems picks up during the time the
signal went from the observer to the vehicle.
Second, there is a constant contribution H to
acceleration/c, i.e.~Hc to acceleration, in
a direction parallel to the radial velocity (i.e.~outward
pointing if the vehicle recedes from the observer).
Hence it acts opposite to the PA and is smaller in modulus
by a factor of . Applied to the Pioneer spacecrafts,
the H t-term amounts to a tiny `anomalous'
acceleration of a/a <10^-12, the Hc -term
to a/a <10^-7.

A final point must be made regarding the choice of the reference
observer-field on which the kinematic quantities related to the
spacecraft (spatial velocity and spatial acceleration) and the
electromagnetic signal (frequency and spatial propagation direction)
crucially depend. In the Minkowskian case the reference field
was just = / t, which is inertial, that is,
geodesic and of vanishing rotation, shear, and expansion. It is
clear that in a general spacetime such observer fields do not
exist and there is no natural choice to replace them. However,
in the case of spherical symmetry there is, in fact, a
distinguished observer field, namely that one whose orbits lie
within the timelike hypersurfaces of constant areal radius and
there run perpendicular to the orbits of the rotation group.
This clearly defines a non-rotating and `non-expanding' (w.r.t.~the
areal radius) reference field. It is the normalization of
the so-called Kodama vector field, which we discuss in detail in
Appendix~. In a FLRW spacetime it is just
given by~(). Notice that in the present case,
where the hypersurfaces of constant cosmological time t are flat,
the areal radius corresponds also to the proper distance. Hence
the integral curves of _* intersect the hypersurface of constant
cosmological time at constant spatial geodesic distance.
More precisely, the expansion and the shear scalar of _* are given
by _*=R^2H H/(1-(RH)^2)^3/2 and _*=- _*/3,
respectively, showing that they are of order H^3 which we neglect.
In passing we remark that the expansion and shear of _* exactly
vanish for the de\,Sitter case, whose metric in `static' coordinates
is given by~() for m=0. In this case
/ t_*= / T, that is, _* is
proportional to the timelike Killing vector field
/ T; see~(). Coming back
to the general FLRW case, the acceleration of _* is given by
_ _*=(-R a/a+R^3H^4)/(1-(RH)^2)^3/2 _*, where
_* is the unit vector field orthogonal to _* and to the
two-sphere, pointing in positive radial direction. Hence, in the slow-motion
and weak-field approximation of Eq.~(),
but keeping also quadratic terms in H, the geodesic equation in the
form~() w.r.t.~the observer field _* reads as

_ _*( )
( \, aa\, r_* ) \; _* \,.

This is just an alternative derivation of the acceleration
term~(). We point out that had we we
taken~() as observer field we would have arrived at
the equation of motion _ ( ) - H _ ( )
instead of~(), that is, no acceleration
term~() would have resulted.

In the approximation within which~()
is derived this equation remains valid if the quantities in it are
re-interpreted so as to refer to _* instead of . Hence we
may sum up the situation by saying that
equations~()
and~() give, respectively, the
two-way Doppler-tracking formula and the `Newtonian' equation in a
FLRW spacetime within the mentioned approximation.

McVittie spacetime

The same analysis can be generalized from the spatially flat FLRW
spacetime~() to the spatially flat McVittie
spacetime~().
Here the observer moves along / t, which is not
geodesic. The coordinate t does now not measure proper
time, denoted by , along the observer's worldline.
The result corresponding to ()
can now be stated as follows:

-\, 12\, _2( _2) _0( _0)
(1-3 -3 (H-m_0c/R^2) )+H \,.

Here R denotes the areal radius of the observer during the
measurement. Note that even though it changes along the observer's
worldline according to (),
we do not need to account for the corresponding change in
m_0c/R^2 of (-2 m_0c/R^2)(H )
which is of subleading order. The additional term in
() has a straightforward
interpretation in terms of the acceleration that the observer
necessarily experiences while keeping a constant radius R
away from the central inhomogeneity.

As for the FLRW case, we chose the observer field to which we refer
the spatial quantities to be proportional to the Kodama vector field
(along which the areal radius is constant). Putting
r_*(t,r):=A^2(t,r)a(t)r and t_*(t,r):=t, a short computation
shows that the vector field / t_* is again
given by~(). In the slow-motion and weak-field
approximation used in Section~, the
geodesic equation in the form~() w.r.t.~the
observer field _* reads

_ _*( )
( aa\, r_* - m_0r_*^2 ) \; _*
\,,

where again _* denotes the unit outward-pointing vector field
orthogonal to _* and to the two-spheres of symmetry. This is an
alternative derivation of the improved Newtonian equation for the
McVittie spacetime carried out in Section~.
Notice that, again, within the approximations used,
relation~() remains valid if one
refers the quantities to _* instead of to . Therefore
() and~()
give the two-way Doppler-tracking formula and the improved
`Newtonian' equation for the McVittie spacetime within the mentioned
approximation.

In the special case of purely radial motion, insertion of
() into ()
leads to a formula predicting the two-way Doppler-shift rate in
linear order in H and m_0/r_*, and quadratic order
in _ _*( ):

-\, 12 _2( _2) _0( _0)
=\,-\, m_0r_*^2 ( 1 - 3 ^ )
+H ^ \,.

Hence there are two corrections to the Newtonian contribution.
One is proportional to H and stems from the cosmological
expansion, the other, already familiar from the special-relativistic
treatment (), is independent
of H and merely due to the finiteness of the propagation
speed of light (recall note~). Their ratio
is (up to a factor 3) given by the square of the ratio
of r_* to the geometric mean of the Schwarzschild radius m_0
and the Hubble radius c/H. The latter is of the order of
10^23\,km, so that its geometric mean with a
Schwarzschild radius of one kilometer is approximately given
by 2400 astronomical units. The ratio of the effects is
therefore of the order 10^-7. Hence the cosmological
contribution is negligible for any application in the Solar
System as compared to the 3 --correction. For the Pioneer~10
\& 11 spacecrafts we have a radial velocity of about 12 Km/s.
This amounts to a 3 --correction of magnitude 4 10^-5
times the Newtonian gravitational acceleration, in an outward-pointing
direction. This is indeed of the same order of magnitude as the
PA but directed oppositely.

Summary and outlook

We think it is fair to say that there are no theoretical hints that
point towards a dynamical influence of cosmological expansion
comparable in size to, say, that of the anomalous acceleration of the
Pioneer spacecrafts. There seems to be no controversy over this
point, though for completeness it should be mentioned that there exist
speculations~ according to which it might become
relevant for future missions. But such speculations are often based
on models which are not easily related to the intended physical
situation, like that of Gautreau~. Rather, as
the ( a/a)--improved Newtonian analysis in
Section~ together with its justification
given in the subsequent Sections shows, there is no genuine
relativistic effect coming from cosmological expansion at the
levels of precision envisaged here.

On the other hand, as regards kinematical effects, the situation
is less unanimous. It is very important to unambiguously understand
what is meant by `mapping out a trajectory', i.e.~how to assign `times'
and `distances'. Eventually we compare a functional relation between
`distance' and `time' with observed data. That relation is obtained by
solving some equations of motion and it has to be carefully checked
whether the methods by which the tracking data are obtained match the
interpretation of the coordinates in which the analytical problem is
solved. In our way of speaking, dynamical effects really influence the
worldline of the object in question whereas kinematical effects
change the way in which one and the same worldline is mapped out
from another worldline representing the observer. Here we have derived
exact results concerning the influence of cosmic expansion on this
mapping procedure, which allow to reliably estimate upper bounds
on their magnitude. They turn out to be too small to be of any relevance
in current satellite trackings, which is in accord with naive
expectation but in contrast to some statements found in the
literature.

At this point it is useful to recall once more the general philosophy
behind such statements: From the Einstein--Straus solution it is clear that
local overdensities inhibit cosmic expansion, or at least that part of
it which is not due to a cosmological constant. Also, as already mentioned
before, the effect of anisotropies is also to diminish the effect
of global expansion (see, e.g., ).
Hence calculating such an effect in simple models like the improved
Newtonian equation discussed in Section~
(backed up by the various justifications we discussed in detail)
clearly means to overestimate the impact of cosmic expansion in a
realistic situation, where the single overdensity (e.g.~representing
the Sun) is surrounded by more overdense structures (the Solar-System
environment, the Galaxy, etc.) with less symmetry. If this
overestimation gives an already insignificant upper bound for the
envisaged effect, we can conclude that it becomes even more
insignificant in more realistic models.

Satellite navigation is clearly not the only potential source of
interest in the question of how local inhomogeneities affect
cosmological expansion. Many predictions concerning cosmological
data rely on computations within the framework of the standard
homogeneous and isotropic models, without properly estimating the
possible effects of local inhomogeneities. Such an estimation would
ideally be based on an exact inhomogeneous solution to Einstein's
equations, or at least a fully controlled approximation to such a
solution. The dynamical and kinematical impact of local
inhomogeneities might essentially influence our interpretation of
cosmological observations. As an example we mention recent serious
efforts to interpret the same data that are usually taken to prove the
existence of a positive cosmological constant in a context
with realistic inhomogeneities~
,
i.e.~taking into account that cosmological parameters are
dressed~. See also
for a recent review. One might speculate that the measured
can eventually be fully reduced to the action of inhomogeneities,
as suggested in in .
For an earlier advance in this direction, see~.

Notation, conventions, and generalities

A model for spacetime consists of a tuple ( , ), where M is
a four-dimensional manifold and a Lorentzian metric whose signature
we take to be (+,-,-,-), i.e.~we use the `mostly minus' convention.
Throughout we denote geometric objects, like tensor fields and covariant
derivative operators, by bold-faced letters or words. The unique metric
preserving and torsion-free covariant derivative associated with will
be denoted by and the covariant derivative in the direction
of a vector by _ . For a smooth tensor field on
M its covariant derivative defines a linear map,
_ , from the tangent space to the tensor space at
each point of where is defined. Since is
again a tensor field (of rank (p,q+1) if the rank of was
(p,q)) we can form := ( ).
Note that ( )( , )= _ _
- _ _ . For a scalar function f on
we have f= f, the ordinary exterior differential, and
f= (f), the Hessian of f.
The metric allows to uniquely associate to any vector
a linear form := ( ,\, \,), called the
dual (with respect to ) of . The inverse of this map will be
denoted by an overline. The gradient of a function f
is then f = f. The metricity of
implies that the latter commutes with the maps \, \, and
\, \,, e.g.~it holds: _ = _ .
The scalar product induced by on the tensor bundle will be denoted
by .

a point p is a curvature endomorphism, ( , ), of
the tangent space at p:

The Riemann- or curvature tensor, , is then defined by

It is antisymmetric under the exchange or

identity).
The Ricci tensor, , is defined by the trace of the

in the tangent space at p is the sectional curvature. Its
geometric interpretation is just that of the ordinary Gaussian curvature
at p of the two-dimensional surface in that is spanned by the
geodesic curves through p tangent to . In terms of
it reads

k_ := ( , , , ) ( , ) \,,

where , are any two linear independent vectors in and

Note that ( , ) gives the square of the area of the
parallelogram spanned by and which is nonzero iff the considered
plane is spacelike or timelike (non-degenerate).

In () we introduced the product ,
which is called the Kulkarni--Nomizu product. It is a symmetric
bilinear map from the space of symmetric (0,2) tensors to
the space of (0,4) tensors with the same algebraic symmetries
as . Its general definition is as follows:

( ) &( , , , ) :=
12 ( & ( , ) ( , )- ( , ) ( , )

This can be used to conveniently write down the -orthogonal
decomposition of the curvature tensor into the Ricci- and the
Weyl part:

= + \,.

In four spacetime dimensions one has

&= ( - 13 _ ( )\, ) \,.

subequations

Inserting this into () gives the
definition of . The definition is such that the Ricci
part is -orthogonal to the Weyl part and that the latter
is totally trace free. Hence the Ricci and the Weyl part
each contribute 10 independent components to the 20 independent
components of . The Ricci part may be further decomposed
according to the decomposition of into its trace and a
trace-free part, but this refinement will not be needed here.

Einstein's equation now express the local determination of
the Ricci part of the curvature in terms of the energy-momentum
distribution of matter, the latter being encoded in the
energy-momentum tensor of the matter. In units where
Newton's constant G and the velocity of light c equal one
Otherwise the factor 8 on the right-hand side
of () should be replaced with 8 G/c^4.,
Einstein's equation reads

Here we did not write down explicitly a cosmological term,
which can always be thought of as extra contribution to
of the form \, /8 . Now, assuming that satisfies
Einstein's equation, the Ricci part of the Riemann tensor is
given in terms of by

= 8 ( - 13 _ ( )\, ) \,.

Proof of Theorem~

In this section we prove Theorem~, namely the equivalence,
in the spherically-symmetric case, of the SSJC with the Darmois junction
conditions.

proof
The proof essentially consists in writing down the induced metric and
extrinsic curvature for a (non-null) spherically symmetric hypersurface
in a spherically symmetric spacetime. This is most easily done by introducing
an adapted orthonormal frame.

We first consider the case where is timelike, hence
= ( ) is a timelike curve in .
The following construction shall be carried out in both spacetimes.
One defines as in the SSJC, hence as the (unique up to a sign)
spherically symmetric, unit vector field on orthogonal to .
That is , seen as a vector field on , is tangent to .
Since is spacelike, is timelike.

The ambient metric can be then written as

= - - R^2 \,,

so that the induced metric (compare Appendix~
and () on is

= - R^2 \,.

In view of () note that here ( )=-1.
For the extrinsic curvature~(),
using~() and the fact that is spherically
symmetric and hence tangent to , one has the decomposition

_ = - ( , _ )\,
- R\, R( )\, \,.

Now, from expressions~()
and~() it follows that the DJC, and
hence the continuity of and _ , are equivalent
to the continuity of the following four functions:

compactenum[ 3ex (a)]
the arc-length of ,
R,
R( ), and
( , _ ).
compactenum

The statement of the theorem will now follow from the following
expression of the MS energy~():

E = R2 ( 1 + ( R( ))^2 - ( R( ))^2 )\,.

Simply note that if R is continuous through (recall the
definition of this concept below the definition of DJC in
Section~) the same holds for its
derivatives tangent to . In particular, R( )
is continuous through and hence we may substitute
R( ) by the MS energy in the above list (a)--(d).
This completes the proof for timelike~ .

In the case of spacelike the unit normal is
timelike and is chosen as the unique (up to a sign)
spherically symmetric unit vector field on
orthonormal to . Then is a spacelike `radial'
unit vector field orthogonal to the SO(3)-orbits.

The proof now proceeds analogously to the timelike case.
We merely list the expressions for the ambient metric

= - - R^2 \,,

the induced metric

= + R^2 \,,

the extrinsic curvature

_ = ( , _ )\,
+ R\, R( )\, \,,

and the MS energy

E = R2 ( 1 + ( R( ))^2 - ( R( ))^2 ) \,,

and conclude exactly as in the timelike case.
proof

Submanifolds

In a Lorentzian manifold ( , ) endowed with Levi-Civita connection
consider a smooth submanifold of co-dimension
one and normal vector field . We assume to be non-null,
that is, either spacelike (then is timelike) or timelike
(then spacelike). Then inherits from the ambient
manifold a (non-degenerate) metric and a connection in a natural
way. We introduce the orthogonal projectors

The induced metric on (also called first fundamental form)
is given by

_ := - ( ) _ \,,

where the sign is just in order to get a positive definite metric in the
case where is spacelike. Given two vector fields ,
tangent to , so that _ = _ =0, one
may decompose the covariant derivative of with respect to
into its orthogonal components

_ &= _ ( _ ) + _ ( _ )

&= _ + _ ( , ) \,,


where

_ := _ ( _ )

and

_ ( , ) &:= ( )\, ( _ , )

& :=- ( )\, ( _ , )

is the extrinsic curvature of in (also called the
second fundamental form). The second equality sign
in~() is an immediate consequence of the metricity
of and the fact that and are orthogonal to .
With this alternative expression for the extrinsic curvature one has
_ = - ( )\, _ and hence
Here and below S and A denote the
projection operators of full symmetrization and full antisymmetrization,
respectively.

_ = - ( )\,S( _ )\,.

Since is hypersurface orthogonal (by definition) we have
A ( _ )=0. Hence,
the extrinsic curvature is a symmetric (0,2)-tensor field. We recall also
that the induced connection is the Levi-Civita connection of
( , ), as one may easily check.

The full relations between the curvature of and those (intrinsic
and extrinsic) of can be found, e.g.,~in~.
Here we are only interested in the `Einstein part' of the curvature.

Spherical symmetry

We recall that the isometry group,
Isom( , ), of a spacetime ( , ) is the subgroup of the
diffeomorphism group of , Diff( ), which leaves the metric
invariant:
Isom( , ):=\ Diff( ) \,|\, ^* = \.

defi[Spherical symmetry]
A four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold ( , ) is said to be
spherically symmetric
if its isometry group, Isom( , ), contains a subgroup G
with the following two properties: (i)~G is isomorphic to SO(3) and
(ii)~each orbit of G is spacelike and two-dimensional (up to
some closed proper subset of fixed points). A tensor field on a
spherically symmetric spacetime is said to be spherically symmetric
if it is invariant under G, hence if ^* = for all
G.
defi

From this definition it follows (excluding the case where the
orbits of G are diffeomorphic to the two-dimensional
real-projective space) that a four-dimensional spherically
symmetric Lorentzian manifold ( , ) can, at least locally,
be expressed as a warped product = _R S^2 between a
two-dimensional Lorentzian manifold ( , _ ), called the
`base', and the standard unit two-sphere (S^2, _S^2), called
the `fiber' (see~ and~).
This means that, at least locally, the manifold is a product

=^ loc S^2

and the metric is given by

= ^*( _ ) - (R )^2 ^*( _S^2) \,.

Here, and are the projections of S^2 onto
and S^2, respectively, and ^*, ^* their pull-backs.
The warping function R is nothing but the
areal radius, since,
for a point p , the area of the fiber p S^2 is just
4 R(p)^2.

In this contest, a vector field on at some point
(p,q) S^2 has then a unique decomposition
= _ + _ in a component
tangent to the `leaves' q = ^-1(q) and a component
tangent to the `fibers' p S^2 = ^-1(p).
Arbitrary tensor fields on and on can be lifted to tensor fields
on in the standard way. For covariant tensor fields (and hence, in
particular, for functions) this is achieved via the pull-pack of the
respective projection: as an example, just look
at~().
For contravariant tensor fields it suffices to consider the special case
of vector fields.
Let, for instance, be a vector in the tangent space of at
p. Then the lift at (p,q) of is defined
as the unique vector in the tangent space of at (p,q)
with _*( )= and _*( )=0.
Since this assignment is smooth, one gets the lifting of a vector field
via the pointwise lifting just described.
In this work, we will mainly omit lifts and projections and not explicitly
distinguish between original and lifted quantities. For example, when
referring to a vector `tangent to ' we refer to a vector in the
tangent space of or to the lift thereof in the tangent space of .

If is spherically symmetric, then the component tangent to the fibers
must vanish: _ =0. Similarly, a spherically symmetric
one-form on must necessarily be tangent to (i.e.~normal
to S^2) and thus it can be written as = ^*( _ ), where
_ is a one-form on . Finally, a spherical symmetric function
is simply the lift of a function on .

Connection and curvature decomposition

In the following we discuss relations which express the curvature of
in terms of the warping function R and the curvatures of the base
and the fiber . We start out from the relations between the
Levi-Civita connection of ( , ) and the Levi-Civita connections
of the base and the fiber, denoted by and , respectively.
These relations can be derived, for example, by means of the Koszul
formula (see e.g.~ Proposition 7.35). Let in the
following , , be vector fields tangent to and , ,
tangent to . Suppressing lifts and projections, we have:

subequations

& _ = _

& _ = _ = R^-1 (R)

& _ _ = _

& _ _ = - ( , ) R^-1 R \,.

subequations

Note that, for a function f on , the lift of the gradient is equal
to the gradient of the lifted function, that is (suppressing the lifts):
f = f. For brevity, we write just f for it.
Take care that for the Hessian and the Laplacian this is in general not
true (see~() and~()).
Therefore we write explicitly the superscripts ` ' in f and
f to denote the Hessian and Laplacian of f on ,
respectively, or the lifts thereof.

By means of~() one can now compute the
expressions for the Riemann tensor. As the sectional curvature of S^2
is obviously constant and equal to one, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci
tensor, and the Ricci scalar of S^2 are simply given by
^ = \! ,
^ = , and
^ = 2, respectively. Here we made again use
of the Kulkarni--Nomizu product (). Moreover,
since the basis manifold is two-dimensional, one can express its
curvature tensors in terms of the scalar curvature. The expression for
the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar of a spherically
symmetric Lorentzian manifold
(,) are, respectively,

&= 2 \!

&- 1R^2 ( 1 + R R )\,
R^2 \! R^2

&+ 2R\, \! \!\! R \,,


&= 2 - 2R R

&+ ( 1+ R R + R R ) \,,


and

=
- 2R^2 ( 1+ R R )
- 4R R \,.

Hence, for the Einstein tensor we have the expression

= & ( 1R^2 ( 1\!+\! R R )
+ 2R R ) - 2R R

&+ ( 2
- 1R R ) R^2


and for the Weyl tensor, using~()
and~(), the simple expression

subequations

= w\,
( + R^2 + R^2 R^2 )\,.

Here we put


w :\!&= 16
( - 2R^2 ( 1\!+\! R R ) +
2R R )
&= 16 + 1R R \,.


subequations

In the derivation of~() we made use of the
formula _ =(1/2)( _ _ ) , valid
To prove this just note that the only independent component
of this formula is the ( _0, _1, _0, _1) one, where
\ _ \ is an adapted orthonormal basis of ( , )
such that _0, _1 are tangent to and _2, _3 are tangent
to S^2. Then, the equality follows immediately using the
definition~() of the Kulkarni--Nomizu product.
for any symmetric bilinear form _ on , in order to express the
only term involving R in terms of the Laplacian of R.
Note that from~() it is immediate that the Weyl
tensor of a spherically symmetric spacetime has only one independent
component, as it must be the case due to it being of Petrov-type D.

Comparing expression~() with the definition
of sectional curvature~() one can immediately
read off that the sectional curvature K of the plane tangential to the
(two-dimensional) SO(3)-orbits at a given point is

K = - 1R^2 ( 1+ R R ) \,,

and hence the MS energy, defined as (minus one-half) K times the third
power of the areal radius, is given by~(). Using the MS
energy~(), we can write the Einstein
tensor~() as:

= & 2R ( R + ER^2 )
- 2R R

&+ ( 2 - 1R R )
R^2
\,.

We conclude giving the decomposition for the divergence of a spherically
symmetric vector field (that is a vector field tangent to ) and
for the Hessian and Laplacian of a spherically symmetric function (that
is a function f on ). First, from~()
and~(), we obtain the following decomposition for
the covariant derivative of (expressed as a (0,2)-tensor):

= - (R)R\, \,.

Note that the mixed term ( - ) vanishes---as it should due to
spherical symmetry. Taking the trace of () one
obtains the following expression for the divergence:

= _ + 2R (R)
= 1R^2 _ ( R^2 ) \,.

The decompositions for the Hessian and Laplacian of a function f on
follow from inserting = f in the above formulae. One gets:

f = f - ( f, R) R\,

and

f = f + 2\, ( f, R)/R \,,

respectively.

Einstein equation in case of spherical symmetry

A general spherically symmetric matter energy-momentum tensor has the form

= _ + p\,R^2 \,,

where p is the spherical part of the pressure. Hence, using the
decomposition~() of the Einstein's tensor
found in Appendix~, the Einstein equation takes
the form

& 2R ( ER^2 + R ) -
2R R = 8 _
& 2 - 1R R = 8 p \,.

Using the trace of the first equation,

1R ( R + 2ER^2\, ) =
4 \, _ \,,

to eliminate R, one can write~()
in the equivalent form

Here, and in the following, denotes the Hodge-duality map
for ( , _ ) (for the definition, see e.g.~).
In the first equation we used the identity

any bilinear form on , where the first (second)
star acts on the first (second) slot of .

Finally, the integrability condition =0 for the
energy-momentum tensor~() reads

_ (R^2 _ ) + p\, (R^2) = 0 \,.

Misner--Sharp energy

Let us now turn to the MS energy and its properties. We first show that
it is the charge of a conserved current. The treatment presented here
follows mainly~. In a spherically symmetric spacetime one
defines the Kodama vector field~ as the (unique up
to a sign) spherically symmetric vector field orthogonal to, and of the
same norm as, the gradient of R; hence we put

:= R \,.

With this sign choice is future-pointing if the gradient of R is
spacelike. The orthogonality between and the gradient of R is
simply expressed by

(R) = 0 \,,

which clearly means that the integral curves of stay at
constant areal radius.

An immediate but important property of the Kodama vector field
is that it is conserved:

= 0 \,.

Indeed, using~() and (),
one has:
= _ = = - R 0.

Now, a key point for the study of spherically symmetric spacetimes is the
following equation relating the MS energy with the matter's energy-momentum
tensor:

E = 4 R^2 \,,

where is the so-called Kodama current (tangent to the base
manifold ) defined by

:= ( , ) \,.

Equation~() follows from Einstein's equation; more precisely, it
is equivalent to its -part (that is Eq.~()) fed
with R. To see this, just compute the differential
of~() as follows:
E
= (E/R) R + (R/2) R R
= (E/R) R + R R R
= R ( (E/R^2) + R ) R,
where the dot denotes here the contraction of the last slot of the tensor
on the left with the first slot of the tensor on the right of the dot.
In the second step we use that ( R R)( )
= ( ( R, R)) = 2\, ( _ R, R)
=2 R( R, ) for any tangent to .
Then, inserting~() and using that is
skew-adjoint on one-forms, one gets
E= -4 R^2 _ R
= 4 R^2 _ R
and hence, using the definitions~() and~()
together with the symmetry of , one arrives at~().

From~() it is clear that

(E)=0 \,,

which means that the vector field is tangent to the curves in
(hypersurfaces in ) of constant MS energy. Moreover, ()
implies that is also conserved

=0 \,,

where the divergence is here taken on the spacetime ( , ). To see this,
just compute the divergence of with~() and using
the Hodge-dual version of~():

= R^-2 _ (R^2 )
= R^-2 (R^2 )
=(4 R^2)^-1 E 0.

Following~, we can now show that the charges corresponding
to the conserved currents and are, respectively, the MS energy and
the areal volume. Let be some spatial three-dimensional
hypersurface which, because of spherical symmetry, decomposes as
= , where is some spatial curve in .
Recall that the charge related to a conserved current is given by
Q_ ( ):= _ i_ , where is the volume
form on , and, because of spherical symmetry, the latter decomposes as
= _ R^2 _ , where _ and _ are the
volume forms on and on the unit two-sphere, respectively.
After integration of the spherical part and since i_ _ = ,
using~() one gets

Q_ ( ) = _ E\,,

which means that the charge of is the MS energy.
This justifies the interpretation of the MS energy as a quantity associated
to the `interior' of the considered sphere of symmetry. In fact,
due to~(), the charge does not depend how one
choose the spatial slice to define the interior. Similarly, since
i_ _ = = R, the charge to is simply
_ 4 R^2 R and hence

Q_ ( ) = _ ( 4 3R^3 )\,,

which says that the charge of is the flat-space volume
computed with the areal radius.

Incidentally, the Kodama vector can be used to give an elegant
proof of Birkhoff's theorem, which states that spherically symmetric
solutions of Einstein's equations are, in fact, static. Indeed, by
direct computation one shows that in vacuum is Killing and,
because of spherical symmetry, it is clearly also hypersurface
orthogonal.

Next we turn to the relation between the MS energy and the Hawking
quasi-local mass~. The latter is a quantity
associated to a spatial two-sphere, S, in an arbitrary spacetime.
It is defined by

M_ H(S) := Area(S)16
( 1 + 12 _S ^+ ^- _S ) \,.

Here, ^ := _ ( ^ )/2 are, respectively,
the expansions of the outgoing and ingoing future-pointing null
vector fields ^ normal to S, the latter being
partially normalized such that ( ^+, ^-)=1 (there remains
the freedom to rescale ^ ^ 1 ^ ,
where is a positive real-valued function). In the special case of
spherical symmetry we take S to be an orbit of the rotation
group. Then we clearly have Area(S)=4 R^2. It is also
obvious that the metric of the base , evaluated on S, can
simply be written in the form

= ^+ ^- + ^- ^+\,.


Now, for tangent to S, ()
gives _ ^ =R^-1 ^ (R) so that
^ =R^-1 ^ (R). Hence we have:

2\, ^+ ^-
= 2R^-2\, R( ^+) R( ^-)
= R R/R^2 \,,

where we used (), or rather its
contravariant version, in the last step. Equation~()
now establishes the equality between the MS energy at p and the
Hawking quasi-local mass of S, where p is any point on S:

E(p) = M_ H(S)\,.

As is the case for the Hawking quasi-local mass, the MS energy can be
naturally decomposed into a Ricci and a Weyl part:

E = E_ R + E_ W \,,

where

subequations
alignat3

&E_ R &&:= - 12R^3 K_ R \,,

&E_ W &&:= - 12R^3 K_ W \,.
alignat
subequations

Here K_ R and K_ W denote, respectively, the Ricci and
the Weyl parts of the sectional curvature of the plane tangential to
the SO(3)-orbits. These are obtained inserting the decomposition of
the Riemann tensor~() in the definition of the
sectional curvature~().
The Ricci part of the MS energy is determined by the local matter distribution
via Einstein's equation: Using expressions~()
and~() for an arbitrary spherically symmetric
energy-momentum tensor and, respectively, metric
in~() one gets

E_ R = 4 3R^3( _ +p) \,.

For the Weyl part of the MS energy we have, in view
of~(), that

E_ W = - 12R^3 w \,,

where w is given by~()
or~(). Hence, in particular, the Weyl
tensor vanishes iff E_ W does. Since the square of the Weyl
tensor is
W_ W^ =12 w^2,
with~() we obtain the nice expression

= 48 E_ W^2R^6 \,.

From this one sees that, in a spherically-symmetric spacetime, the
non-vanishing of E_ W (that is the non-vanishing of the Weyl tensor)
for R 0 implies a curvature singularity at R=0.

To gain a better physical understanding of the Weyl part of the MS energy
we take a look at the equation of geodesic deviation (sometime called Jacobi
equation). Let be a geodesic observer field and the spatial
( ( , )=0) separation vector between two nearby integral curves
of . Then the equation of geodesic deviation (see
e.g.~) is
_ _ = ( , ) = _ ( ) + _ ( ). In the
last step we decomposed the endomorphism on the r.h.s.~of the geodesic
deviation equation in its Ricci- and Weyl-part, denoted here by _
and _ , respectively. For an arbitrary spherically symmetric
spacetime the latter is given by (see~()
and~())

_ = 2E_ WR^3 _ ^ -
E_ WR^3 _ ^ \,,

where _ ^ and _ ^ are, respectively, the and
parts of the projector _ . Recall that _ projects onto the
subspace of the tangential space orthogonal to
(see~()). Equation~() is exactly
the same expression one gets in Newtonian gravity---provided one identifies
E_ W with the mass of the central object. The spatial endomorphism
_ just describes the familiar volume-preserving tidal deformation
which produces an expansion in radial direction and a contraction in
the orthogonal directions tangential to the SO(3)-orbits.

Concerning the Ricci part _ , in the case where is the velocity
field of dust
Recall that dust particles moves along geodesics by the Euler
equation.,
making use of Einstein's equation (see~()) we have:

_ = - 4 3 \, _ \,.

This just says that the local effect of matter (here given by dust) is an
isotropic contraction.

Spherically symmetric perfect fluids

We specialize now to a perfect fluid, which is described by a four-velocity
vector field , density , and pressure p. In case of spherical
symmetry is tangent to the basis manifold and the matter energy-momentum
tensor~() decomposes as

= \, + p\,( - )
+ p\,R^2 \,,

from which one can read off the part tangent to :

_ = \, + p\,( - ) \,.

Usually, the description is to be completed with the specification of an
equation of state. We will not assume any equation of state yet, since in
some cases (e.g.~McVittie spacetime) this happens to be determined by
Einstein's equation.

Inserting~() in~()
we get for the Ricci part of the MS energy the simple expression

E_ R = 4 3R^3 \,.

Also the expression~() for the differential of the MS energy
simplifies in case of a perfect fluid. Using~()
the Kodama current (as one-form) becomes

= ( +p) ( , )\, - p\, \,.

It is useful to introduce an adapted orthonormal basis \ , \ tangent
to the basis manifold, where is the velocity vector field of the fluid
and is chosen to point in direction of increasing areal radius. Because
of our choice of orientation we have = (the volume form
on is simply _ = ).
Using this expression for and the definition of the Kodama vector
field~() we have ( , )=
= R =- R =- R
=- R( ) and hence, the Hodge star of the Kodama current becomes

= -p\, R( ) - \, R( ) \,,

which, inserted in~(), gives the following expression for the
differential of the MS energy for a perfect fluid:

E = -4 R^2
( p\, R( ) + \, R( ) ) \,.

Hence, the variation of the MS energy along and is, respectively:

subequations
alignat3
& E( ) &&= - &&4 R^2\, p\, R( ) \,,
& E( ) &&= + &&4 R^2\, \, R( ) \,.
alignat
subequations

These expressions have a good physical interpretation: Since the matter
moves along , () expresses the fact that the energy
can only increase (decrease) if the motion along does (releases) work
against (with) the action of the pressure. Equation~()
expresses the almost obvious increase (decrease) of gravitational mass
with increase (decrease) of volume in the rest system of the matter.
We said `almost' because 4 R^2 R( ) is not quite the increment
of proper volume. The difference accounts for the fact that kinetic
and gravitational binding energy are themselves gravitationally active.
To see that this is indeed what () implies, let p
be some point in spacetime and S_p the two-sphere of spherical symmetry
through p. Assume S_p to have a regular interior, that is, that
S_p bounds a 3-ball B_p in the hypersurface orthogonal
to . Except for the origin of B_p, we can write
B_p= , where is a spacelike curve in
orthogonal to , going from the center of symmetry to (p).
Using the expression E=(R/2)(1 + ( R( ))^2 - ( R( ))^2)
for the MS energy to eliminate R( ) in~(),
integrating the latter over , and re-expressing the result
as a volume integral, one gets:

E(p) = _B_p
( 1 + ( R( ))^2 - 2ER )^1/2 _ \,.

One sees that the MS energy contains the contribution from the
proper mass contained in the ball B_p,

M(p) = _B_p \, _ \,,

as well as contributions from the `kinetic' and `potential'
energy~. In a Newtonian approximation,
that is for small `velocity' R( ) and weak field (small E/R) one
can expand the square root in~() and gets, in leading
order:

E(p) _B_p ( + 12 ( R( ))^2 -
MR ) _ \,.

In this approximation the MS energy is therefore just the sum of the
proper mass and the Newtonian kinetic and potential energies contained
in the ball B_p. This provides a sound justification for the
interpretation of the MS energy as the active gravitational energy.

At this point we can compute also the differentials of the two
parts~() of the MS energy separately. The
differential of the Ricci part follows directly
from~():

E_ R = 4 R^2
( \, R + 13R\, )

and the differential of the Weyl part is just the difference of this
with~():

E_ W = -4 R^2
( ( +p) R( )\, + 13R\, ) \,.

It is now instructive to express the variation along of the Ricci and
Weyl parts of the MS energy in terms of the kinematical properties of the
fluid velocity . Recall that, because of spherical symmetry, the
rotation tensor vanishes identically and the shear tensor has only one
independent component. The kinematical quantities reduces thus to two
scalars: the expansion

:=

and the shear scalar

:= R( )R- 13 \,.

The shear tensor is then given by the trace-free endomorphism
= ( _ - 2\, _ ), where _
and _ denote, respectively, the projections onto
the two-dimensional subspace of T( ) tangential to the two-sphere and onto
the one-dimensional space parallel to (for the latter
see~()).
We recall that the divergence-freeness of the energy-momentum
tensor~() is equivalent to

where b:=- ( _ , ) is the acceleration (scalar) of in
positive radial direction (the minus sign in the latter formula is because
the metric is negative definite in spatial directions).

Now, using~() and~() we get:

With the equations just derived we can now say when the MS energy, and its
Ricci and Weyl parts, are temporally or spatially constant. Here, by
temporally (spatially) constant we mean that the variation in direction of
( ) vanishes. We collect the results in the following

thm
Consider a spherically symmetric fluid with +p 0 and restrict
to the region where dR is spacelike. Then for the MS energy E and
its Ricci and Weyl parts E_ R and E_ W the following
statements hold true:

compactenum[(i)]
E is temporally constant iff p=0 or R( )=0;
E is spatially constant iff =0;
E_ W is temporally constant iff =0;
E_ W is spatially constant iff is spatially constant;
E_ R is temporally (spatially) constant iff R^3 is
temporally (spatially) constant.

The proof is a straightforward application of the formulae just derived above.
Note that the assumption +p 0 is needed only for (iii).
The assumption that R is spacelike is needed only for (ii): If
R is spacelike, then for any spacelike spherically symmetric vector
(hence tangent to the basis manifold ) it holds
R( ) 0, since in a two-dimensional Lorentzian manifold any
two spacelike vectors are linearly dependent.
