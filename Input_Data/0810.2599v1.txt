abstract

Infrared carbon stars without visible counterparts are generally known as
extreme carbon stars. We have selected a subset of these stars
with absorption features in the 10-13\, range, which has been
tentatively attributed to silicon carbide (SiC). We add three new objects
meeting these criterion to the seven previously known, bringing our total
sample to ten sources. We also present the result of radiative transfer
modeling for these stars, comparing these results to those of previous
studies. In order to constrain model parameters, we use published mass-loss
rates, expansion velocities and theoretical dust condensation models
to determine the dust condensation temperature. These show
that the inner dust temperatures of the dust shells for these sources are
significantly higher than previously assumed. This also implies that the
dominant dust species should be graphite instead of amorphous carbon. In
combination with the higher condensation temperature we show that this results
in a much higher acceleration of the dust grains than would be expected from
previous work.

Our model results suggest that the very optically thick stage of evolution
does not coincide with the timescales for the superwind, but rather, that
this is a very short-lived phase.

Additionally, we compare model and observational
parameters in an attempt to find any correlations. Finally, we show that the
spectrum of one source, IRAS 17534-3030, strongly implies that the
10-13\, feature is due to a solid state rather than a molecular species.

Introduction

Physical evolution of intermediate mass stars and their circumstellar shells

Stars between about 1 and 8\,M_ will eventually evolve up the
Asymptotic Giant Branch [AGB;][]Iben1983. Because of instabilities in
their interior, AGB stars pulsate and throw off large amounts of mass from
their surface
[e.g.,][]Vassiliadis1993. This intensive mass loss produces a circumstellar shell of dust and neutral gas.
Once the AGB star has exhausted its outer envelope, the AGB phase ends.
At this point, the mass loss virtually stops and the circumstellar shell
begins to drift away from the star.
At the same time, the central star begins to
shrink and heat up from 3000\,K until it is hot enough to ionize the
surrounding gas, at which point the object becomes a planetary nebula (PN).
The short-lived post-AGB phase, as the star evolves toward to the PN phase, is
also known as the proto- or pre-planetary nebula (PPN) phase.
During the ascent of the AGB, the
velocity of the outflowing mass appears to be fairly constant
[e.g.,][]hug88,fong03. Therefore the dust furthest from the star
represents the oldest mass loss, while material closer to the star represents
more recent mass loss. Towards the end of the AGB phase
the increasing
impact of the thermal pulse cycles leads to an increasing mass-loss
rate
[e.g.,][]vw93,vil02a. Such an increase in mass-loss rate (dubbed the
superwind) is necessary to explain the densities seen in typical PNe
. Since the invocation of the superwind,
many observations of AGB stars and post-AGB stars have supported this
hypothesis [e.g.,][]km85,wood92.

Chemical evolution of AGB stars and their circumstellar shells

The chemical composition of the atmospheres of AGB stars is expected
to change as these stars evolve, due to convective dredge up of carbon
produced in the He-burning shell. The amount of carbon relative to oxygen (the
C/O ratio) is critical in determining which types of dust and molecules
are present around
an AGB star. The formation of extremely stable CO molecules will consume
whichever of the two elements is less abundant, leaving only the more abundant
element available for dust formation. Stars start their lives with the cosmic
C/O ratio of 0.4 and are therefore oxygen-rich. In about a third of
AGB stars, enough carbon will be dredged up to make C/O > 1 and therefore
carbon will dominate the chemistry around these stars, known as carbon stars.

Carbon stars are expected to have circumstellar shells dominated by amorphous
or graphitic carbon grains, which do not have diagnostic infrared features.
Another component of the dust shell around carbon stars, silicon carbide (SiC),
does have an infrared spectral feature at 11 and therefore has
been of great interest to researchers seeking to understand the evolution of
the dust shells and infrared features of carbon stars
.

Extreme Carbon Stars

As carbon stars evolve, mass loss is expected to increase. Consequently, their
circumstellar shells become progressively more optically thick, and
eventually the central star is obscured. Volk1992,Volk2000
christened such stars ``extreme carbon stars''.
These stars have also been dubbed ``infrared carbon stars''
, and ``very cold carbon stars'' .
Extreme carbon stars are expected represent that small subset of
carbon-rich AGB stars which are in the superwind phase, just prior to
leaving the AGB.

Because the superwind phase is short-lived compared to the AGB phase the
number of extreme carbon stars is intrinsically small. Consequently, few
of these objects are known. At present there are 30 known extreme carbon stars in the Galaxy
compared to 30,000 known visible carbon stars .

vh88 attempted to define a way to distinguish between oxygen-rich
and
carbon-rich AGB stars using IRAS color-color space, which was divided into
subsections according to the properties of the dusty shells are these stars
[see Table~1 of][]vh88. This was further refined
by omont93 who identified a population of very cold carbon stars using
HCN and CO observations, and showed that the regions originally designated as
extremely dusty O-rich AGB stars also contain a significant fraction of C-rich
stars.

The refinement of the vh88 color-color diagram by omont93
defined subdivisions of the seven zones in color-color space
[see Fig.~1 in][]omont93.
Cool carbon stars with high mass-loss rates (and little or no SiC emission)
fall into regions III and IV, which had previously been assumed to define
OH-IR stars (i.e. the oxygen-rich counterparts to extreme carbon stars). The
numbered regions have been subdivided into smaller regions denoted by
IIIa1, IIIa2, IIIb1 etc.

A subset of the color-color space, covering parts of
regions IIIa1c, IIIb2, IIIb2 and VIb is reproduced in Fig.~ and
includes our sample stars.

SiC absorption features

SiC has long been predicted to be present in carbon star circumstellar shells,
beginning with condensation theories and
continuing with the prediction of a characteristic SiC 11
spectral feature and then the observational discovery of
an 11 emission feature in many carbon star spectra
.

The effect of the evolving dust shell density structure on observed
features, and particularly on the 11 feature, have been discussed
extensively
[see review in][and references therein]Speck2005.

As the optical depth of the dust shell increases, self-absorption
will diminish the 11 feature and it will
eventually be seen in net absorption.
SiC self-absorption was found to be important in producing accurate
radiative transfer models of extreme carbon stars
[e.g.][]Volk1992, even though this previous work did not recognize
SiC absorption features.

These absorption features are rare and have mostly been ignored in
discussions of
evolutionary sequences in carbon star spectra. In fact the rarity of such
absorption features led to the hypothesis that SiC becomes coated in carbon at
high optical depths [e.g.][]Baron1987,Chan1990.
However, meteoritic data and theoretical models do not support this hypothesis
(see ~ and ~).

A few extreme carbon stars have been shown to have an absorption feature at
11 which has been tentatively attributed to SiC. This feature was
discovered in the ``prototype'' extreme carbon star AFGL~3068
[hereafter referred to as IRAS\,23166+1655;][]Jones1978,
and was re-examined by Speck1997, which also
identified three additional extreme carbon stars with this feature.
Clement2003 examined the absorption features of two of these extreme
carbon stars (IRAS\,23166+1655 and IRAS\,02408+5458),
and showed that their 11
absorption features are consistent with -SiC

Silicon carbide exists in many (>70) different crystal structures, known as
polytypes. See Speck1997,daulton03,Pitman2007 for a discussion of
the polytypes of SiC.

nanoparticles.

The broad absorption features of IRAS\,19548+3035 and IRAS\,21318+5631
[also discovered by][]Speck1997 were attributed to SiC absorption
with an interstellar silicate absorption contribution
[see also][]Groenewegen1996. This will be discussed further in
~.

The absorption features in the spectra of IRAS\,19548+3035 and IRAS\,21318+5631
were revisited by Clement2005 who suggested Si_3N_4 grains as the
carrier. However, this hypothesis has been shown to be erroneous
.

The failure of the Si_3N_4 hypothesis led Speck2005 to suggest that
amorphous SiC grains may be able to account for the breadth, structure and
barycentric position of the observed broad 10-13 feature in
IRAS\,19548+3035 and IRAS\,21318+5631.
However, the dearth of amorphous presolar SiC grains seems to
preclude this hypothesis (see ~).

An alternative explanation for this feature is molecular line absorption,
however, currently available line lists are not sufficient to properly
assess this hypothesis [see][and references therein]Speck2006.
One molecular candidate which has transitions in the correct wavelength
range is C_3
[e.g.][]zijl06,jorg, but the line lists are not readily
available. Furthermore, C_3 is expected to be photospheric, rather than circumstellar,
which probably precludes its detection in optically obscured stars.
Moreover, the theoretical spectrum of C_3
from jorg shows a strong absorption close to the 5 CO
line, which is stronger than the 11 feature. As will be seen in
~, the spectrum of IRAS\,17534-3030 does not show the 5
absorption band and provides evidence that the
observed absorption feature is not molecular in origin.

Though previous research has included the effects of SiC self-absorption
[shown to be crucial to produce accurate
models][]Volk1992,Speck1997,Speck2005,
no work has been done to directly fit the apparent SiC absorption feature in
radiative transfer models of extreme carbon stars.

Previous Radiative Transfer Models of Extreme Carbon Stars

Volk1992 performed radiative transfer modeling in order to match the
Infrared Astronomical Satellite [ IRAS;][]neug84 Low Resolution
Spectrometer (LRS) data for several of extreme carbon stars.
They determined that the exact star temperature entered into the
model was not important for the emerging spectra due to the very thick dust
shells around extreme carbon stars
[c.f.][]DePew2006,Speck2000.
Their models used a fixed composition (a mixture of graphite
and SiC), and a fixed dust condensation temperature.

Groenewegen1994 also performed radiative transfer modeling on a larger
set of extreme carbon stars, but these models varied the dust condensation
temperature. Again this was based on IRAS LRS data.
Following up on this, Groenewegen1995 modeled a large sample of carbon stars
using amorphous carbon optical constants ,
and assumed low dust condensation temperature in a fairly narrow range
(650--900\,K for the extreme carbon stars). Consequently the inner dust radius is
larger than expected. Moreover the resulting models all
have relatively low optical depths ( _11.3 m < 2).
The optical depth for their IRAS\,23166+1655 model
was found to be _11.3 m < 1,
even though this star has an absorption feature at 11 .
Groenewegen1998 remodeled these stars, again assuming relatively low
dust condensation temperatures, with similar results.

Finally, Volk2000 used the improved spectral resolution of the
the Infrared Space Observatory [ ISO;][]kessler Short Wavelength
Spectrometer [SWS;][]degraauw96 to examine five extreme carbon stars.
In their modeling study, Volk2000 allowed the optical depth and radial
dust density distribution to vary; the resulting optical depths were
relatively high (1.4-4.5 at 11.3 ), and the density of the dust shell was
found to increase rapidly towards the center. This increase was interpreted as
evidence of an increasing mass-loss rate within the last few thousand years,
consistent with the identification of extreme carbon stars as the final stage
of AGB star evolution. While these models did include SiC opacity data, the
11 absorption feature was not recognized and consequently no attempt was
made to fit this feature in these models.

A summary of the parameters of previous models for extreme carbon stars with
11 absorption features in our sample can be
found in Table~. Interestingly, all previous models assume
relatively low inner dust temperatures. This will be discussed further in
~.
Furthermore, the modeled dust density distributions suggest a relatively slow
increase in mass-loss rates (1/r^x, where x 2.25---3.0).

In reality, dust shells are expected to have heterogeneities and anisotropies
in their density structure
as a result of pulsation-driven dust formation and the
ensuing hydrodynamic turbulent effects [e.g.][]woitke06.
These dust formation models suggest that carbon star mass-loss is expected
to be modulated on several timescales, especially that of the pulsation cycle.

Furthermore woitke06 has suggested that
the dynamics in the dust-forming zones around carbon stars lead to
inhomogeneous dust formation, producing fine scale structure in the density of> the dust envelope.
In addition, while pulsation shocks are predicted to have a strong effect on
local conditions [e.g.][]cherchneff06,
this is not reflected in temporal changes in the IR spectra of carbon stars
.
As will be seen in ~, the
spatial scale of the heterogeneities is small and the
timescale for pulsations is short compared to the timescales associated with
even the thinnest dust
shells. Moreover, the inhomogeneities are expected to be wiped out over time
by the hydrodynamic interactions . Consequently, we do
not consider these small scale structures in our models.

Meteoritic Evidence

The isotopic compositions of certain grains found in primitive meteorites
indicate that they originated outside the solar system and are thus dubbed
``presolar''.

Dust grains from AGB stars are found virtually unaltered in
these meteorites, demonstrating that these grains become part of the next
generation of stars and planets [][and references therein]cn04.
The precise physical characteristics of these meteoritic dust grains
(e.g. sizes, crystal structures, compositions) can be used to help constrain
the nature of the dust we see in our astronomical observations.

Presolar silicon carbide

Silicon carbide was the first presolar grain to be found in meteorites
and remains the best studied
[][and references therein]bern05.
The most important findings of this work are
(1) that most ( 99\
carbon stars;
(2) of the AGB SiC grains, 95\
carbon stars (<3\,M_ ), based on nucleosynthesis models of isotopic compositions;
(3) that all the SiC grains are crystalline (not amorphous);
(4) that nearly all ( 80\
remainder comprising the lower temperature 2H polytype;
(5) that with one exception, SiC grains have not been
found in the cores of carbon
presolar grains (unlike other carbides: TiC, ZrC, and MoC); and
(6) that the grain size distribution includes both very small and very large
grains (1.5\,nm 26\, ), with most grains in the
0.1--1 range.
Single-crystal grains can exceed 20 in size.
Observations of the 11 feature have been compared with
laboratory spectra of various forms of SiC, and after some false
starts it has now been attributed to -SiC, matching the information
retrieved from meteoritic samples .
However, there are still some discrepancies between
observational and meteoritic evidence (most notably related to
grain size).

prombo
found a correlation between grain size and the concentration of
s-process elements in SiC grains taken from the Murchison meteorites.
The Indarch meteorite presolar SiC grains yielded similar results
. In both cases, the smaller grains have higher relative
abundances of s-process elements. This observation may be a result of
different metallicity sources yielding different grain-size distributions
. Alternatively, it may reflect an evolution
in grain-size with dredge-up .

Presolar ``graphite''

In addition to SiC presolar grains, carbon grains are also relatively abundant
and well studied [see][and references therein]bern05.
Presolar carbon grains are usually referred to as ``graphite'' grains, but
their structures are more complex than this name infers.
Presolar graphite is found in two types of spherules classified according to
their external morphologies as ``onion-like'' and ``cauliflower-like''.
In general the graphite spherules follow a similar size distribution to the
SiC grains. However, the high-density grains
( 2.15-2.20\,g\,cm^3) associated with AGB stars have a
mean size of 2 . In addition, the AGB presolar graphite spherules span a
larger range of isotopic compositions than the SiC grains, possibly suggesting
that they form at a wider range of times during the AGB phase.

While the presolar SiC grains tend to be single crystals, the graphite grains
regularly contain carbide grains. These carbides are enriched in s-process
elements, indicative of formation around late-stage AGB stars.

Many of the ``onion-like'' graphite grains have a core mantle structure in which the
core contains disordered agglomerations of graphene

Graphene is basically a single sheet of graphitic material. If it is
disordered, there are some heptagons and pentagons in place of the regular
hexagonal carbon structure. Graphite is the 3-d structure.

sheets and PAH polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-like
products, while the mantle is composed of well-ordered graphitic concentric
shells. The graphene particles have a typical size of 3-4nm.

The ``cauliflower-like'' graphite grains also have a concentric shell
structure, but it is less well ordered, and is composed primarily of the
disordered graphene.

Whether ``onion'' and ``cauliflower'' graphites are formed in the same
outflows is not known. Both types of grain contain the refractory carbides and
both span the same range of isotopic compositions.

Whether the ``onion'' or ``cauliflower'' grains are more representative of
grains in the outflows of extreme carbon stars is not known. However, even the
most disordered ``cauliflowers'' or ``onion''-cores are still closer to
graphite
than glassy carbon in structure. The least ordered grains are still considered
to be agglommerations of nano-crystalline grains, rather than truly amorphous
(pers.\ comm.\ K. Croat).

Other presolar carbides

As discussed in ~ and ~, refractory carbides
are found inside ``graphite'' grains but not in SiC grains. Furthermore, SiC
is not one of the carbides found in ``graphite'' grains. The refractory
carbides (TiC, ZrC, MoC and RuC) provide more constraints on the dust
formation processes around carbon stars. In particular, the formation of
``graphite'' spherules with TiC nuclei limits the range of C/O ratios in which
these grains could form to 1 C/O 1.2.
Meanwhile, the ZrC can form nuclei at higher C/O, but the value still needs to
be less than two.
This is consistent with the measured C/O ratios of Galactic carbon stars,
which have an average of 1.15 and a maximum of 1.8

Investigation
In the present work, we investigate a subset of extreme carbon stars, those
which exhibit the 11 absorption feature. Through radiative transfer
modeling, we investigate the nature of these dust shells. We use theoretical
models and meteoritic data to limit the parameter space and thus reduce the
degeneracy within the model results.
In addition, we look for correlations between observed parameters, such as
those that define the 11 feature (strength, position, etc) as well as
mass-loss rates and expansion velocities associated with the dust shells.

Finally we determine timescales associated with the dust shells.

Observations and Data Processing

We investigated 10 extreme carbon stars observed spectroscopically by the ISO
SWS all of which show evidence for an 11 absorption feature
(see Table~ and Figs.~, ,
and ).
These sources were chosen by searching the ISO archive
for spectra of extreme carbon stars listed in Volk1992 and selecting
those with an apparent 11 absorption feature. In addition, we used the
color-color classification of ``very cold'' carbon stars by omont93 to
identify further potential sources. Unfortunately most of the potential
sources found in the color-color space (e.g. IRAS\,17583-2291) were not observed
by ISO SWS, and the IRAS LRS spectra are too low resolution and/or too noisy to
be used in the present study.

Four of our sources (IRAS\,02408+5458, IRAS\,19548+3035, IRAS\,21318+5631, and
IRAS\,23166 +1655)
were previously studied using ground-based observations and were found to be
consistent with a self-absorbed SiC feature .
Two of these sources needed an extra absorption component at 10 ,
which were attributed to interstellar absorption. As discussed in
~, these have since been the source of some controversy
.

Following the modeling efforts of Volk2000, Speck2005
identified IRAS\,00210+6221, IRAS\,06582+1507, and IRAS\,17534-3030 as exhibiting
an SiC absorption feature. The modeling of Volk2000 did not include
SiC and did not attempt to fit the 11 absorption. Thus, division of the
observed spectra by their respective RT model spectra revealed the 11
absorption feature.

In this paper we present the discovery of three more potential SiC absorption
features in ISO SWS spectra (IRAS\,01144+6658, IRAS\,03313+6058, and
IRAS\,22303+5950). These were discovered by searching the ISO archive for any
extreme or ``very cold'' carbon stars as determined by their location in the
IRAS color-color space. Those sources that fall within region III without
OH maser emission were examined.

The locations of the stars in our sample in IRAS color-color space
are plotted in Fig~.
Interestingly, all sources except IRAS\,19548+3035
plot along a line parallel to and between the
blackbody emission and the B(T, ,T) ^-1 emission lines.

The raw ISO data were extracted from the ISO data archive, and we used the
Off-Line Processing (OLP) pipeline, version 10.1. Individual spectral
sub-bands were cleaned of glitches (caused by cosmic ray particles) and other
bad data sections. Next, they were flat-fielded, sigma-clipped (using the
default values = 3) and rebinned to the final spectral resolution
(R= / ), which ranged from 200 to 700, depending on the scanning
speed of the SWS grating during the observation . The final
spectra are presented in Figure~, which also shows the
best-fitting
Best fits are achieved by eye and proceed by examination of the
continuum-divided spectra.

blackbody continuum for each spectrum and the resulting
continuum-divided spectra. The blackbody temperatures of the continua at
listed in
Table~.

The continuum-divided spectra clearly show an absorption feature in the
10-13 region, the basic parameters of which (barycentric position,
peak-to-continuum ratio, full width half maximum; FWHM) are listed in
Table~.

The excellent match between the overall spectrum and a single temperature
blackbody suggests that we are seeing an isothermal surface within the dust
shell. This represents the depth at which the shell becomes optically thick.
The lack of extra emission at longer wavelengths suggests that any outlying
dust is low enough in density to have an insignificant contribution to the
overall emission.

In addition to the ISO\/ SWS spectra, Fig~,
and shows the
IRAS\/ LRS spectra and the IRAS\/ 12, 25, 60 and 100
photometry measurements. The difference in the flux levels between the
IRAS\/ and ISO\/ data is not unexpected, since these stars are
variable. However, the shape of the spectrum does not change significantly
between the two observations, suggesting that changes in the stellar
luminosity do not significantly impact the structure and composition
of the dust shells.

In order to determine the cause of the 10-13 feature and the factors
that govern its strength, width and position we have tabulated the barycentric
position, feature-to-continuum ratio and equivalent width of the feature
(Table~). In addition, we have also tabulated where the
barycenter of the SiC feature would be if the short wavelength side of the
absorption is due to silicate (as has been postulated, see ~).
This, along with the feature-to-continuum ratio measured at 9.7 and
11.3 , can be found in Table~.

The ``30 '' feature

Another prominent spectral feature exhibited by our sample of extreme carbon stars is the so-called ``30 '' feature.
This feature is relatively common amongst carbon-rich AGB stars, PPNe
and PNe and was first discovered in Kuiper Airborne Observatory ( KAO)
spectra of carbon stars and PNe . It has been widely
attributed to magnesium sulfide [MgS; e.g.][]gm85,nuth85,omont95,begemann94,hony2002.
Modeling this feature is beyond the scope of the present work, but will be
investigated in follow-up modeling. Our models make no attempt to fit the ``30 '' feature.

Radiative Transfer Modeling

Radiative transfer modeling has been particularly useful in investigating
extreme carbon stars
[see ~;][]Volk1992,Groenewegen1995,Volk2000.

We used the 1-D radiative transfer program DUSTY
, to determine the effect of dust shell
parameters on the emerging spectra from carbon stars.

In all cases, the central star was assumed to be at 3000\,K (typical
for an AGB star). Speck2000 and DePew2006 showed that
changing this
temperature by 1000\,K did not significantly change the radiative
transfer model's spectra [c.f.][]Volk2000. For simplicity,
dust grains are assumed to be spherical. While DUSTY can include other grain
shapes, this expands parameter space to create more degeneracy between models
and is beyond the scope of the present work.

Radial dust density distribution

We assume a radial dust density distribution of
1/r^2 which would reflect a constant mass-loss rate.
This choice is somewhat controversial and certainly needs justifying.

Current dust formation models suggest that carbon star mass-loss is expected
to be modulated on several timescales, especially that of the pulsation cycle
[][and references therein]woitke06. Furthermore woitke06 has
suggested that
the dynamics in the dust-forming zones around carbon stars lead to
inhomogeneous dust formation, producing fine scale structure in the density of
the dust envelope.

While pulsation shocks are predicted to have a strong effect on local
conditions [e.g.][]cherchneff06,
this is not reflected in temporal changes in the IR spectra of carbon stars
.

Previous models of extreme carbon stars have included steeper a density
drop-off [see
Table~;][]Volk1992,Volk2000,Groenewegen1995,Groenewegen1998,
which is meant to represent the increasing mass-loss rate associated with the
onset of the superwind phase. However, vil02a,vil02b
showed that
the hydrodynamics in the circumstellar shell wipe out density structure and
leave a shell with a 1/r^2 density distribution. In addition
rrh83 showed that carbon star spectra can be well-fitted using such a
density distribution.

In our models we assume that modulations in density have
been wiped out or are unimportant in determining the spectrum at these high
optical depths, as we are clearly seeing an outer dust shell surface.

We also assume we are only detecting the dust that has formed since
the onset of the superwind. We assume that there was a
sudden increase in mass loss at some time in the last 10000\,years
and that this mass-loss rate is now approximately constant, with small scale
fluctuations being unimportant for dust properties.
Consequently, the 1/r^2 density distribution suffices.
As will be seen in ~, the impact of assuming a steeper the
density distribution is to remove dependence on shell size, and thus remove
the ability to out limits on timescales. If we were to adopt a
1/r^3 density distribution, all the dust would effectively be
contained close to the star and would reflect the total mass lost over only a
relatively short period.

Modeling grain-size distributions

The issue of choosing a grain size distribution is interesting and certainly
requires more discussion. Our initial modeling studies used an MRN distribution
[i.e., n(a) proportional to a^-q, where n is the number of the
grains in the size interval (a,a + da) and q=3.5;a_min=0.005 ; and
a_max=0.25 ;][]Mathis1977.

This was chosen because as will become evident below,
we do not actually know the grain size
distribution and MRN is as plausible as any other.

However, the MRN distribution was developed for interstellar dust where the
balance of formation and destruction is different from AGB circumstellar
environments. dsg89 suggested that the grain-size
distribution created in the circumstellar environments of AGB stars has a
steeper power law (i.e.\ a^5), while [][KMH]kmh modified the MRN
distribution to include an exponential fall-off term.

We should also consider the ``observational'' evidence for range and distribution
of grain sizes in carbon star outflows.

Meteoritic presolar SiC grains from carbon stars have a huge grain-size
distribution, ranging for 1.5nm up to 26 , with the majority of grains
( 70\
[see][]daulton03,bern05,cn04.
Half the mass of the presolar SiC found in the Murchison meteorite is in
grains larger than 0.6 .
Carbon presolar grains follow a similar grain size distribution to SiC
.
However, the sample may be biased
in favor of large grains, which may be more apt to survive the journey through
the ISM and incorporation into a solar system body.

Conventional theories of
grain growth cannot produce the largest grains. Since AGB stars typically have
mass-loss rates < 10^-5 M_ \,yr^-1 there should be an upper
limit to the grain sizes of 0.1 .
However, this assumes an isotropic distribution of material. The existence of
meteoritic titanium carbide (TiC) within presolar carbon grains necessitates
density inhomogeneities in the gas outflows [c.f., inhomogenities caused
by turbulence in hydrodynamic models of carbon-rich dust formation
regions;][]woitke06.

In addition, the grains must be 1 to produce the 11
feature, implying that
there is a large population of small grains (but not necessarily precluding
large grains). Constraints on grain size were also discussed by mr87
who found an upper limit to the grain size of 0.1 based on
polarization measurements of the famous carbon star, IRC+10216. On the other
hand, Groenewegen1997 used polarization measurements to limit the
grain size to 0.1 a 0.35 and suggested that very small grains
(<80 nm) may not exist around carbon stars (however, smaller SiC grains are found in meteorites). Meanwhile, jura94 argued
the case for grains larger than 1 in the circumstellar shells of
IRC+10216.

Towards the end of the AGB the onset of the superwind may lead to mass-loss
rates as high as a few 10^-4 M_ \,yr^-1
[e.g.][]hony2003 which could translate into larger grains
[see e.g.][and references therein]bern05.
However, the relationship between the evolution of carbon stars and the
consequent evolution of grain sizes in their circumstellar shells was discussed
by Speck2005. They argued that the increased mass-loss rates at the
end of the AGB phase lead to smaller, rather than larger grains as suggested
by meteoritic evidence. Even the
highest observed mass-loss rates cannot account for formation of titanium
carbide (TiC) grains unless the distribution of material is not
spherically symmetric and density enhancements exist . Such a
distribution of material makes the concept of grain size distributions even
more complex.

The range of grain sizes used in previous radiative transfer modeling attempts
varies hugely.

The IRC+10216 models of griffin1990 required grain sizes limited to
5 a 50nm. Similarly bdg95 required grains smaller than
50nm.

Groenewegen1997 also modeled IRC+10216 and found that the spectrum was
best fit using a single grain size of 0.16 (rather than a distribution
of grain sizes). The single-grain size approach was also adopted by
Volk2000 who assume a single grain size of 0.1 .
This is supported by the success of the early carbon star models of
rrh83 who also used a single grain size (0.1 ).
However, since extreme carbon stars are expected to be the direct precursors
for post-AGB objects, it may be more appropriate to consider the models of
post-AGB stars. Such modeling efforts have found they need grains up to
millimetre- or even centimetre- in size [e.g.][]jura2000,meixner2002.
meixner2002 used a KMH-like distribution with
an effective maximum grain size of 200 (hereafter referred to as KMH200).
Meanwhile, szc97 modeled a carbon-rich post-AGB object with a
power-law distribution of grains in the range 0.01--1 .

Given the range of possible grain sizes and distributions, it is difficult to
know how best to model the dust.
Groenewegen1995 argued that the specific grain-size is not important
as long as the grains are small enough that the absorption and scattering
properties are independent of grain size. However, given the arguments for a
population of large grains, limiting grains to smaller than 0.1 is
unrealistic.

In order to determine the effect of the choice of grain sizes on the model
spectra we have generated models using five additional grains size
distributions:
1) MRN-like with a steeper power law, i.e. a_min = 0.005 ,
a_max = 0.25 ; q=5 [as suggested by][]dsg89;
2) only 0.1 -sized grains
[as used or suggested by][]Volk2000,rrh83,Groenewegen1995,mr87;
3) the dominant meteoritic grain sizes, i.e. 0.1--1 only;
4) the standard KMH distribution (i.e. n(a) a^-qe^a/a_0,
a_min = 0.005 , a_0 = 0.2 ; q=3.5); and finally
5) KMH200: KMH with a_0 = 200 .

The results of this study are shown in Fig.~, which shows the
effect of changing the grain size distribution while keeping all other
parameters constant.

If we examine the differences in the spectra generated by changing the
grain-size distributions, this can be understood in terms of the absorption
efficiency of the grains and breadth of the grain size distribution.
Changing from our default grain size distribution (MRN) to a modified MRN-like
distribution with a steeper power law drop off (q=5) as suggested by
dsg89 makes very little difference to the model spectral energy distribution (SED).
Likewise, switching from MRN to KMH has little effect on the overall shape of
the SED.
That the MRN, q=5 and the KMH models are so similar is because they are
basically weighted towards the same small grains. While the weighting is
different, the same-sized small grains dominate the SED.

However, changing the size distribution to include larger dust grains as used
in models of post-AGB stars [e.g.][]meixner2002 has an major effect.
The SED shifts to peak at much shorter wavelengths. This is because of the
reduction in the number of small grains in order to include larger grains. The
proportion of larger
grains is small, but the removal of the smaller grains makes it possible for
the stellar photons to penetrate deeper into the dust shell and provides a
large population of warmer grains, resulting in a warmer SED.
In both the KMH200 and 0.1 cases there is a lack of very small grains
which absorb a lot of stellar photons and change the temperature distribution
(i.e.
after the first layer of dust the temperature is lower, but if there are no
small grains the stellar photons penetrate further.) Since size distributions
similar to KMH200 are typically associated with long-lived dust disks, this
particular distribution is not considered further.

For the meteoritic grain size distribution, the short wavelength side of the
SED is similar to the default (MRN) model, but now the SED is much narrower.
This can be explained by the very narrow range of grain sizes. There are no
very small grains that can be easily heated and thus the shorter wavelength
emission seen in KMH200 does not occur, but the lack of small grains also
allows deeper penetration of stellar photon leading to a narrower temperature
distribution.

This grain size study suggests that for most adopted grain-size distributions,
the resulting SEDs will be equivalent and we assume the MRN distribution as
``generic''. However, the meteoritic grain-size distribution can narrow the
overall SED.

For this reason, our modeling efforts concentrate on the generic (MRN) and ``meteoritic'' grain size distributions, where the ``meteoritic'' is taken to be an extreme amongst the range of reasonable grain-size assumptions.

The impact of choosing different grain size distributions and the implications
of these differences for the potential errors in our models
will be discussed in ~. However, essentially, most grain-size
distributions will yield the same results except for ``meteoritic'' and
KMH200. In both cases changes in optical depth, inner dust temperature and/or
relative geometrical shell thickness can be manipulated to fit the spectrum.
There is a degeneracy in model fits due to the relationship between these
three parameters that will be discussed in the next section.
As will be seen in the ~, the grain size effects cannot be
ignored. In one source the need for ``meteoritic'' grain-size distribution
is clear.

Parameter space investigated

In addition to grain sizes and radial density distribution, the variables investigated with DUSTY are the
inner dust shell temperature (T_ inner),
optical depth (specified at 10 ; _10 m),
dust composition, and
the geometrical thickness of the dust shell, = R_ out/R_ in,
where
R_ in and R_ out are the inner and outer radii of the dust
shell, respectively.

The optical constants for the dust components came from
Pegourie1988,Hanner1998 and DL84 for SiC, amorphous carbon
and graphite, respectively.

In nearly all cases it was possible to generate more than one model to fit the spectra, consequently we also investigate this degeneracy in parameter space and
look for realistic ways to restrict it.

Degeneracies in radiative transfer modelling

There is a clear degeneracy in the models because of the relationship between
certain parameters, e.g. optical depth and geometric shell thickness, or
optical depth and the temperature at the inner edge of the dust shell.
ie97 discussed these degeneracies and the relationship between the
different input parameters in radiative transfer models, but we
need to understand these relationship if we are to
understand what our models mean.

The wavelength-dependent optical depth, _ is defined by:

d _ = (r) _ dr


where (r) is the density of the absorbing/scattering particles
(i.e. the dust grains) and _ is the wavelength dependent
opacity of the assemblage of particles along the line of sight.

_ = ^R_ out_R_ in (r) _ dr


where R_ in is the inner dust shell radius and R_ out is the
outer dust shell radius.
While _ is dependent on the density distribution of the grains,
maintaining the size, shape and composition
(and crystal structure) of the grains means that _ will not
change significantly.
For simplicity we assume _ remains constant.

In our models we assume the density of the dust shell drops off as 1/r^2
from the central star. In addition, our models specify the relative geometrical
thickness of the dust shell as = R_ out/R_ in. Thus we get:

_ = _ [ - 1 R_ in ]


The value of R_ in is set by the values we input for the star's
effective temperature and the inner dust radius (or condensation
temperature, T_ inner).
If we know the temperature and luminosity of the star, we can use a
T(r) r^- 12 temperature distribution to determine the
relationship between T_ inner and R_ in and
substituting into Eq.~ we get:

_ = 16 L_ ~ _ T_ inner^2 [ - 1 ]

Here we assume that the grains are blackbodies because they are largely
carbon. Including the albedo would allow for a more accurate calculation, but
this would depend on detailed dust parameters (like crystal structure), and the error incurred by our assumption is small
(i.e.\ significantly less than an order of magnitude).

Therefore, according the Eq.~, for a dust shell with constant
relative shell thickness ( ) the optical depth
should increase with the square of the inner dust temperature. Alternatively,
if the inner dust temperature is fixed, then increasing the relative shell
thickness should decrease optical depth a little (as ( - 1) / ).
This latter effect becomes negligible for large geometric sizes.

Determining the Dust Condensation Temperature

Theoretical dust condensation models

As seen in the previous section, the value of the dust condensation
temperature is a source of degeneracy on radiative transfer modeling.

In order to reduce this degeneracy we turn to dust condensation
theory to determine a theoretical dust condensation temperature
(i.e. T_ inner) that is appropriate for our stars.

As discussed in ~, many presolar grains can be attributed to
carbon stars and are valuable resources for investigation of dust formation
regions. For example, in presolar grains titanium carbide (TiC) is found in
the center of carbon (C)
grains from AGB stars, but only one SiC grain has been found coated in carbon
.

Consequently there have been many studies of the theoretical condensation
sequence in Galactic carbon stars in attempts to constrain the physical
parameters of the dust condensation regions.
These studies showed how the condensation sequence of C, TiC and SiC is
dependent on various parameters, most notably C/O ratio and gas
pressure
Gas pressure is a measure of the mass-loss rate ( M) convolved with the
photospheric temperature (T_ ) and outflow velocity (v_ exp).
.

sw95 argued
that if carbon forms at a higher condensation temperature, closer to the star
than SiC, there is a significant decrease in
the amount of carbon available in the gas, and thus SiC and C do
not form simultaneously, resulting in naked SiC grains. Therefore, for Galactic
sources, the condensation sequence in the majority of carbon stars should be
TiC --- C --- SiC, in order to produce the coated TiC grains and uncoated
(naked) SiC grains seen in the meteoritic presolar grains samples.

Observational evidence for naked SiC grains is discussed by Speck2005.

sw95 argued that from kinetic and stellar model considerations, dust
grains should form in the pressure range 2 10^-7 < P <
4 10^-5 bars
The expected range of gas pressures in the dust formation zone for
O-rich AGB stars in the LMC is 10^-7 bars P 10^-4
bars .

lf95 also modeled the effect of C/O and pressure on the condensation
sequence in carbon stars, as well as the effect of s-process and
nitrogen abundances. They also briefly discuss the effect of metallicity.
The general trends in condensation temperatures are:
(1) all condensation temperatures decrease as the gas pressure decreases; and
(2) At C/O > 1 the condensation temperature of graphite increases with C/O
(for a given pressure and otherwise constant composition).

Figure~ shows how the condensation temperature of carbon and
SiC vary with the gas pressure in the dust condensation
zone. For the range plotted carbon always forms first from a cooling gas.
Very high pressures are required for SiC to form before carbon.

For solar metallicity and C/O = 1.05, SiC forms before carbon for
P 3.4 10^-5 bars.
As C/O increases, the minimum pressure required to form SiC first increases.

Above C/O 1.5 carbon always forms before SiC. The exact C/O ratio at
which
the carbon forms before SiC depends on pressure. Therefore, in order to
account for observations of SiC features in the Galaxy, and the presolar
grain record, we can restrict the P--C/O space such that, for low C/O the gas
pressure must remain low, but for higher C/O the pressure can be higher.
This can be used to constrain the dust forming environment around Galactic
carbon stars.

Studies of carbon star spectra in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds have
lead to different interpretations with respect to the condensation sequence.
Lagadec2007 argued for a sequence in which SiC forms before C in the
Galaxy, whereas SiC and C form together in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
and the sequence is reversed (C, then SiC) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). However, they also suggest that the change in the strength of the features is
due to the lower number of Si atoms available for SiC formation.
The proposed Galactic condensation sequence is at odds with both the models
and the meteoritic evidence. leisenring support the condensation
sequence in which C forms before SiC for the
Galactic carbon stars, while finding that the Magellanic Clouds tended to form
SiC first, followed by simultaneous condensation of SiC and C.
Speck2006 used the lf95 model to explain an unusual LMC carbon
star spectrum, which suggests that the condensation sequence is sensitive to
both metallicity and mass-loss rate.

P-T space in the condensation zone around extreme carbon stars

In order to constrain the input parameters to our model we need to be able to
determine the pressure-temperature space in the dust condensation zone.

For a mass-losing star with a mass-loss rate M and
an expansion velocity of v_ exp,
the density of the circumstellar shell
at a radius r is given by:

= M4 r^2 v_ exp

If we know the temperature and luminosity of the star and the composition of
the outflowing material we can combine this information with the Ideal Gas Law
and a T(r) 1/ r temperature distribution to determine
the
gas pressure at the condensation radius, where the condensation radius is the
distance from the star where the gas has the condensation temperature
(T_ cond).

For simplicity, the solid and gas phases are assume to be at the same
temperature. While this is clearly a simplification [e.g.][]chigai,
the temperature difference is small compared to the difference needed to
significantly affect dust formation.

We assume that most of the outflowing material is atomic hydrogen. In fact it will probably be a mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen (H_2) since H_2
forms around 2000\,K and the temperature in the outflow is decreasing from
the stellar surface temperature of 3000\,K to the dust condensation
temperature in the 1000--1800\,K range.

An entirely molecular hydrogen gas would halve
the gas pressure compared to the the atomic gas.

However, we also assume published CO outflow velocities, which reflect the
speed of the outflowing material after radiation pressure acceleration.
Adopting the pre-dust-formation outflow speed ( 5km/s), would increase
the pressure.

Thus using published values for our sample stars' luminosities,
mass-loss rates and expansion velocities, we can estimate where their dust
condensation zones fall in P--T space.

Comparison of P--T space for dust condensation models and sample
stars

Figure~ shows how the P--T space for the dust condensation zone
for our target stars compares to condensation models in P--T space.
It is clear the pressure is never high enough for SiC to form before
carbon. Since our sample stars are expected to be the carbon stars with the
highest mass-loss rates, it implies that this NEVER happens in Galactic carbon
stars.
This agrees with the meteoritic evidence which suggests that SiC does
not get coated in carbon and supported the idea that variations in the
strength of the SiC feature are related to self-absorption.

The dust condensation temperature is dependent on the pressure in the gas from
which the dust forms.
In addition, the P--T space occupied by the target sources suggests
that carbon grains will form at temperatures 1600\,K.
If the C/O is
very high, then graphite could form as high as 1800\,K.
However, Galactic
carbon stars for which the C/O ratios have been measured show that it is
in the range 1 to 1.8, with a mean C/O ratio of 1.15
. The precise C/O for our sample is not known,
but even low C/O stars yield T_ cond 1550\,K
(see Fig.~).
Previous models of carbon stars have assumed much lower inner dust
temperatures.
The pressures and temperatures in the gas around these
stars meet the criteria for forming carbon dust at T_ cond
1600\,K, (precise temperature depends on the C/O ratio). Therefore it should
form at these high temperatures.

Once dust starts to form, the radial temperature profile will change due to
absorption of starlight by dust grains.
Therefore, we use the comparison above only to determine the inner dust radius.
Using radial temperature profiles from our models we show that the temperature
drops significantly more rapidly than 1/ r (see Fig.~),
which suggests that the
next condensate (SiC) forms fairly close to the inner dust radius and thus
mitigates the problem with DUSTY that the grains are assumed to be co-spatial.
Indeed the models show that the temperature in the dust shell drops to the SiC
formation temperature at 1.3R_ in for all cases, which is small
compared to the shell thickness, even for the thinnest shells.

Constraining Dust Composition

Since our stars are carbon-rich, we limit the models to only including
carbonaceous species such as graphite, amorphous carbon and silicon carbide.
The choice of carbon grains is equivocal. We do not know whether the grains
composed mostly of carbon are glassy, poly-nanocrystalline or well-ordered.
The meteoritic presolar ``graphite'' grains suggest that circumstellar dust
can contain either well-ordered graphite or poly-nanocrystalline-graphene
grains. It should be noted, however, that even the disordered graphene sheets
are considered to be more graphitic than amorphous.

Amorphous carbon essentially consists of a mixture of sp^2 (graphite-like)
and sp^3 (diamond-like) carbon bonds. On heating, sp^3 bonds tend to
convert to sp^2 bonds, thus graphitizing the amorphous carbon, but it will
remain dense like the amorphous phase
[2.8\,g/cm^3][]comelli,saada,kelires.
At 1300\,K the fraction of
graphitic bonds is 90\

Comparison of the gas pressure in the circumstellar outflows to graphite
formation temperature in ~ shows that graphite should be able to
form at temperatures significantly above 1300\,K. Even if solid state carbon
forms as a chaotic solid, at these temperatures it will quickly anneal to a
graphitic form.

Consequently, we argue that graphite is the better choice of carbonaceous
material for modeling extreme carbon star dust shells.

The limitations of the use of the Pegourie1988 data are discussed in
Pitman2007. Clearly, this data cannot produce the broad absorption
feature seen in the observations. However, we can use the relative changes in
composition from star to star as a guide to understanding why these stars
have the features we see.

Radiative Transfer Modeling Results

The results of the radiative transfer modeling can be seen in
Fig.~, and .
The parameters used in each case can be seen in Table~.
For each source, we have produced models using both MRN (generic) and
``meteoritic'' (extreme) grain size distributions.

The effect of grain-size distribution

Table~ shows the model input parameters for both grainsize distributions.
In all cases switching from MRN to ``meteoritic'' grainsizes leads to the need for increased SiC component
(compared to graphite), typically requiring a three- or fourfold increase in the SiC fraction.

There are other general trends including the need for decreased optical depths ( _10 m) and
increased geometric shell thickness. However, these trends do not hold for all objects.
In the cases of IRAS\,00210+6221 and IRAS\,06582+1507, the only difference in parameters between
the different grain size models is the fraction of SiC.
IRAS\,01144+6658 is the only source for which optical depth was increased and shell thickness was
decreased in the ``meteoritic'' model.

Dust Shell Thicknesses

As discussed in ~, there is a degeneracy between relative shell
thickness, inner dust temperature and optical depth. The inner dust
temperature variability has been limited to 1550--1800\,K by
theoretical considerations (see ~).

It is possible to tweak parameters such as
shell thickness, inner dust temperature and optical depth and get almost
identical models. Fig.~ shows two almost identical model
spectra for IRAS\,23166+1655 with different inner dust temperatures,
optical depths and shell
thicknesses. However, reducing the inner dust temperature merely requires
reduction of the optical depth.

While increasingly geometrically large dust shells can be accommodated by
decreasing optical depth (see Eq.~), at some point, this also
breaks down, as it leads to a significant population of colder grains which
emit too much at long wavelengths. In this way we can use the models to place
to an upper limit to the shell thickness.

Table~ lists the published expansion velocities for our
extreme carbon stars.
From the model parameters, the physical value for
R_ out can be calculated,
which gives the physical size of the dust shell.
Since the models give an upper limit to the shell thickness,
this upper limit to R_ out together with the expansion velocity (v_ exp)
was used to calculate the
time since the outermost edge of the shell was ejected from the star.
The resulting ages of the dust shells are listed in Table~.

As can be seen in Fig.~, it is possible to accommodate thick
shells, if we assume a much lower T_ inner (1000\,K), and assume that
the dust grain are composed of amorphous rather than graphitic carbon, but
these parameter values are precluded by the theoretical constraints
on T_ inner and composition/crystal structure discussed above.
Clearly, since our constraints are theoretical, they may change as hypotheses
are refined.

The timescales for increased mass-loss are model dependent. As can be seen in
Table~ using a ``meteoritic'' grain size distribution generally
requires a geometrically thicker shell, as well as lower values for
_10 m and higher percentages of SiC. However,
timescales associated with our dust shells are always very short (less than a
few thousand years) regardless of grain-size distribution.
Moreover, our timescales are consistent with those derived for the
``superwind''
seen in post-AGB objects [e.g.][]skinner97,meixner2004.
These timescales are too short to be associated with the theoretical
superwind [e.g.][]vw93,
which is expected to last up to 10\
thermally-pulsing AGB phase.
However, if we compare the number of extreme carbon stars to the
total number of carbon stars in the Galaxy, we find that extreme
carbon stars constitute only 0.1\
C-star population. The thermally pulsing AGB phase is expected to last
10^6 years, and the time a star spends as a C-stars is even
shorter [e.g.][]Lagadec2007. Consequently, we might expect the
dust-obscured phase to only last
10^3 years. This is consistent with the model timescales,
although the MRN-models still appear to have very short timescales.

LZ08 suggested that the trigger for the superwind is a combination of
luminosity and carbon abundance. Although the duration of the C-star phase
maybe be 3 10^5\,years, for much of this time, a C-star will be
below the critical carbon abundance required to drive the superwind and
obscure the star.

How does the extreme carbon star phase fit into the broader C-star evolution?
Many, if not most, carbon-rich post-AGB stars showed marked axisymmetric
morphologies .

The extreme carbon stars are expected to be the
direct precursors of these objects [e.g.][]skinner98, but presently
show little evidence for
axisymmetry one would expect to see more near-IR emission in the
spectrum of strongly axisymmetric objects due to scattering of starlight
escaping in the bipolar axis direction..
The cause and timing of this axisymmetric structure is not known, but is
believed to occur at the very end of the AGB phase.
ds06 showed that significant axisymmetry is not expected to develop
until the last few tens or hundreds of years of the superwind phase.
The onset of axisymmetry also leads to an optically thicker toroid of dust, as
the circumstellar shell becomes equatorially enhanced.
We suggest that the very short timescales associated with our model results
may indicate that the extreme AGB stars are in the process of developing
axisymmetry, but that this has not developed to the point of allowing large
amounts of NIR scattered light into the spectrum.

Dust Shell Density Distribution

In ~ we argued the case for maintaining a dust density
distribution that follows a 1/r^2 law. However, it has been argued that the
increasing stellar luminosity and the onset of the superwind phase should
give rise to a steeper density drop-off.

Following the same arguments as shown in ~,
giving rise to Eq.~ we can derive an equation in which the
exponent of the density power law is a variable.

This gives us the relationship between the optical depth ( _ ),
inner dust temperature (T_ inner), relative shell thicks ( ) and
the exponent of the density power law (x):

_ = _ [ ^x-1-1(x-1) ^x-1 ] ( 16 L_ T_ inner^2 )^x-1



where _ is the wavelength dependent opacity of the assemblage
of particles along the line of sight;
L_ is the luminosity of the star; and
is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

As an example of the effect this, we assume the exponent, x = 3
(which is the highest value in the previous models).
In this case, the relative shell thickness dependence dwindles, and the
optical depth is essential strongly dependent on the inner dust
temperature only.
Since the previous models have severely underestimated the inner
dust temperature, they have also underestimated the optical depth
[which may explain][]Groenewegen1995.

The lack of dependence on shell thickness at x > 2 leads to a situation
where most of the dust is essentially confined to a region close to the star
and the outer dust becomes negligible, and so this confinement to the inner
region is effectively the same as our assumption that there was a
sudden increase in mass loss in the recent past.

However, we attempted to model our sources with a 1/r^3 radial
density distribution and found that we cannot match the shape of the SED
without restricting the geometrical shell thickness.
Using the 1/r^3 radial density distribution with the MRN grain-size
distribution and R_ out/R_ in 20 produces a SED that has
too much emission longwards of 20 .
Therefore, even if the radial density distribution is indicative of a steep
increase in mass-loss rate the shells still need to be geometrically thin, and
the shell thickness and percentage of SiC needed are essentially the same as
for the 1/r^2 models
(see Fig.~ for an example.)

If the ``meteoritic'' grain-size distribution is used in conjunction with a
1/r^3 drop-off, the observed SED cannot be matched. The model SED
becomes too narrow, and increasing the outer dust-shell radius does not help.

IRAS~17534-3030

IRAS\,17534-3030 is exceptional amongst the present sample of extreme carbon stars,
and certainly requires more discussion.
As can be seen in the flux-calibrated and continuum-divided spectra in Fig.~,
IRAS\,17534-3030 does not exhibit the usual molecular absorption bands around 13.7
(due the C_2H_2) and shortwards of 8 (due to both C_2H_2 and HCN),
which are present in the other sample sources. Its 11--13 feature is intermediate
between the narrow feature exemplified by IRAS\,23166+1655 and the broad feature
exemplified by IRAS\,19548+3035, indicating that at least some of whatever substance
causes the broadening is present around IRAS\,17534-3030.
One of the suggested carriers for the short wavelength broadening of the 10-13
absorption feature is C_3 . However, C_3 is expected to be photospheric,
rather than circumstellar, which probably precludes its detection in optically obscured stars.
Moreover, the theoretical spectrum of C_3
from jorg shows a strong absorption close to the 5 CO
line, which is stronger than the 11 feature. The spectrum of IRAS\,17534-3030
does not show this 5 absorption band. This, together with the lack of other
molecular absorption feature provides evidence that the
broadening of the 10-13 feature is not molecular in origin.

In addition to the lack of molecular absorption in its spectrum,
IRAS\,17534-3030 is unique is another way: it cannot be modeled with the MRN grain-size distribution.
Modeling of this source requires the ``meteoritic'' grain-size distribution because of its narrow SED.
Whereas our other sources can be fitted with either MRN or ``meteoritic'' grains, IRAS\,17534-3030
cannot.

Impact of the dust condensation temperature

The increase in the inner dust temperature from \,1000\,K in previous
models up to
\,1600\,K decreases the inner dust radius significantly.
Consequently the flux of energy from the star hitting the inner dust radius
is increased, leading to a greater acceleration and consequently a more
effectively dust-driven wind. If graphite is formed by annealing of amorphous
carbon, the grain density should remain high (with =2.8g/cm^3) and
the increased acceleration is entirely due to increases flux of stellar
photons.
However, if graphite forms directly, rather than by
annealing of amorphous carbon, the radiation pressure effect is further
enhanced, because graphite grains generally have a
lower density than amorphous carbon. Assuming 0.1 -sized grains,
the acceleration felt by graphite grains (with =2.2g/cm^3; c.f.
meteoritic presolar grains; see ~) at
T_ inner = 1800\,K is 13 times greater than the
acceleration felt by amorphous carbon grains (with =2.8g/cm^3)
at T_ inner = 1000\,K.

Correlations between observed and model parameters

In the course of this investigation we have compiled a large number of
parameters for these stars. For instance, Table~ lists the peak
position, peak strength, FWHM and equivalent width
of the 11 absorption feature.
Table~ lists the published mass-loss rates, luminosities and
expansion velocities for our sample stars.

In order to understand the physical conditions that give rise to the observed
11 absorption feature, we have sought correlations between various
parameters associated with the sample stars (as found in
Table~, , ).
We have looked for correlations between each of the following:
mass-loss rate (from CO observations);
expansion velocity (from CO observations);
stellar luminosity;
strength of the observed absorption;
FWHM of the absorption;
barycentric position of the absorption;
equivalent width of the absorption;
and model parameters.

Loup1993 showed that, for low mass loss rates there is a
simple relationship between the [25]-[12] color and mass-loss rates.
This breaks down at mass-loss rates 10^-5\,M_ ^-1.
It has been suggested that such high mass-loss rate stars at CO-emission
deficient due to either saturation effects, low kinetic temperatures or
possibly dramatic recent increases in mass-loss. If we extrapolate the
trends from low mass-loss rates to determine mass-loss rates from the
[25]-[12] color we find that these objects should have a mass-loss rate
in excess of 10^-4\,M_ ^-1, consistent with the high
modeled optical depths. Because of this relationship, we sought
correlations between the various observed and modeled parameters and
the [25]-[12] and [60]-[25] colors. This search yielded only one correlation:
between the [60]-[25] colors and the dust mass-loss rate from previous models.
It is possible that a better correlation may be found using the
Manchester Method i.e. the [6]-[9] color
[e.g.][]Sloan2006,zijl06, however, we suspect that the lack of
correlation arises because of the intrinsic degeneracy in the modeling.

In ~ and ~
we discussed the possibility that the broadening of the
10--13 feature might be due to silicate dust.
With this in mind, we re-measured the position and strength of the 11
feature assuming that the short wavelength wing is due to silicate.
This involved
measuring the feature-to-continuum strength at 9.7 and 11.3 . These data
are tabulated in Table~ and were also included in the
investigation of correlations between parameters.

One pair of parameters that yielded a correlation were
the best-fit blackbody temperature and the model optical depth,
which is demonstrated in Fig~.
This correlation occurs whether we assume MRN or ``meteoritic'' grainsizes.

Since there is a relationship between the optical depth and shell thickness,
this correlation seems to support models validity.

In addition to this relationship between the modeled optical depth and the
best-fit blackbody temperature, we found two other parameters that the optical
depth correlates with: modeled percentage of SiC in the dust shell; and the
calculated timescale of the obscuring dust. In both cases, these correlations only hold for the generic (MRN) grain-sze distribution models.
(shown in Fig.~).
The correlation between optical depth and percentage SiC is such that lower
optical depths
require more SiC. This in turn suggests that as mass-loss rates increase, the
SiC component dwindles. This can be interpreted in two ways:
(1) at these high mass-loss rates SiC gets coated by carbon; and
(2) increased mass-loss rates are associated with higher C/O ratios;
carbon is enriched but not silicon, and thus more carbon
grains can be made, but not more SiC grains.

The first option seems unlikely in light of meteoritic evidence ( ~) and
theoretical condensation models ( ~).
However, it is possible that there is a metallicity effect in play.
The presolar grains were formed prior to the formation of the solar system,
and thus their source stars may have had lower metallicities.
Speck2006,leisenring argued that coating of SiC grains is more
likely in lower metallicity environments, and thus it is difficult to see how
the higher metallicity objects we are now witnessing could have carbon-coated
SiC grains.
However, leisenring argued that SiC grains form the nucleation seed for MgS,
which may explain this correlation.
The second option may be logical if outflows are dust driven.
If more carbon grains can form, the radiation pressure driving the outflow is more effective.

The second optical depth correlation is with the calculated timescale (also
shown in Fig.~ and again, only for the MRN grain-size
distribution). In this case,
the timescale for the dustshell increases with optical depth.
The oldest shells have the highest optical depth.

This may simply be due to the pathlength dependence of optical depth
(see Eqn.~), since depends on the geometric size of the dust
shell the oldest shells should have the largest optical depth. However, this
should also lead to a correlation between model dust shell thickness and
optical depth. No such correlation exists.

Another interpretation is that older stars have higher mass-loss rates, and
thus denser dust shells and higher optical depths. However, this assumes the
stars all had the same initial mass.

This apparent correlation is not strong, and does not holds for ``meteoritic''
grains. Consequently, we will not attempt to place too much importance on it.

There is no correlation between the strength of the 9.7 absorption and
that at 11.3 , implying that the carriers of these features may not be
related. Furthermore, there is no correlation between the 9.7
strength and distance to the object, which leads us to suggest that the cause
is not interstellar. Obviously there is a strong correlation between the
strength of the 9.7 absorption and the barycentric position of the
feature, indicating that this is the cause of the broadening.

The most interesting correlations are between the ``isolated''
11.3 feature (i.e. the residual feature after taking silicate absorption
into account) and the fitted blackbody temperature.
There is a correlation both between the SiC
barycentric position and the blackbody
temperature and between the 11.3 feature-to-continuum ratio
(i.e. SiC feature strength) and the blackbody temperature (both shown in
Fig.~).

The position of the SiC absorption feature moves to shorter wavelengths for
higher
blackbody temperatures while also becoming weaker.
This can be understood as being the result of more absorption occuring when
the surface we see is at a lower temperature,
which is associated with longer wavelength absorption.

We can interpret this result in terms of the self-absorption scheme described
by Speck2005. The shifts in wavelength were attributed to a
changes in grain size. However, the weaker absorption and warmer blackbody
temperatures associated with the shortest wavelength peaks is the opposite
trend to that described by Speck2005. Following their scheme, this
would imply that the weakest absorption is associated with the largest SiC
grain. The problem with interpreting this observation is that we do not know
the C/O ratios for these stars. While C/O does not affect the SiC condensation
temperature, it will affect the graphite condensation temperature. As seen in
Fig~, we can reduce the inner dust temperature and
compensate by decreasing both the optical depth and the shell thickness.
This would also change the depth into the shell at which the SiC forms.
It is also possible that the shift in position is due to
incomplete subtraction of the silicate contribution.
Further studies are ongoing, but are beyond the scope of the
present work.

The assumption that there is a silicate contribution to the spectrum raises
several questions. Identifying the source of the 9.7 contribution to the
absorption feature remains beyond the scope of the present paper, but,
needless to say, if it is silicate, the specter of dual chemistry would
require seriously rethinking our current models of dust formation around
carbon stars. lf99 suggested that silicates could form around carbon
stars, and indeed silicate carbon stars exist.
It is possible that the feature may be attributable to some form
of hydrogenated amorphous carbon, which has been postulated as the source of
an 9 emission feature in optical thin carbon star spectra
[see][and reference therein]Thompson2006.

No additional correlations were found. The lack of correlation between most of
the observable or modeled parameters echoes
the results of Thompson2006, who found that there are no trends in the
parameters associated with 11 emission feature in visibly observable
carbon stars. This suggests that even amongst the extreme carbon stars,
variations in C/O, s-process and nitrogen enhancements make discernment of
the physical properties associated with the 11 feature very difficult.

Conclusions

We have presented three previously unrecognized SiC absorption features in the
spectra of extreme carbon stars. Together with the seven known SiC absorption
stars, this brings the total of known extreme carbon stars with SiC absorption
features to ten.

Previous radiative transfer models of extreme carbon stars utilized relatively
low condensation temperatures. Here, theoretical condensation models have
been used to justify much higher condensation temperatures.
In addition, our models use graphite instead of amorphous carbon, because
of the preferential formation of graphite at higher temperature and the
meteoritic evidence. Both the higher condensation temperature (through a
decrease in the inner radius of the dust shell) and to a smaller extent the
use of graphite will greatly increase the acceleration felt by the dust grains
in the shell relative to parameters used in previous research.

We have shown that grain-size issues cannot be ignored in the production
of models that accurately fit the observed spectra of extreme carbon stars.
The size distribution that is needed is not clearly defined because of the
inherent degeneracy in radiative transfer modeling. Meteoritic grain-size
distributions are as valid as other size distributions with the advantage of
being model independent. However, they may underestimate the contribution from
small grains.

With the exception of IRAS 17534-3030, all sample stars could be modeled
with either the generic (MRN) or ``meteoritic grain-size distribution

IRAS 17534-3030's narrow SED required the use of the ``meteoric''
distribution. Furthermore, there is no evidence for any molecular absorption
in its spectrum. Because the 11
feature is still present in the absence of the other molecular features, it
supports the attribution of this feature to a solid state carrier.
	
The various parameters compiled in the course of this research (both
through radiative transfer modeling and from observations) have been compared
in order to identify any correlations, with the result that the cause of
differences is the spectra cannot be attributed to mass-loss rate or gas
pressure in the dust condensation zone.
In fact the paucity of correlations between parameters echoes
the results of Thompson2006 and
suggests that even amongst the extreme carbon stars,
variations in C/O, s-process and nitrogen enhancements make 11
a poor probe of the details of dust shell parameters.

The timescales associated with the heavy mass-loss experienced by these
extreme carbon stars are very short (tens to hundred of years) and are not
consistent with timescales for the superwind. This indicates that the heavy
mass-loss phase of carbon stars is not a direct result of thermal pulse
(although thermal pulses may be the root cause).
