abstract
IC~348 is a young (t 3Myr) and nearby (d 340pc) star forming
region in the Perseus molecular cloud. We performed a deep imaging
survey using the MEGACAM (z-band) and WIRCAM (JHK and narrowband
CH_4 on/off) wide-field cameras on the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope. From the analysis of the narrowband CH_4 on/off deep
images, we report 4 T-dwarf candidates, of which 3 clearly lie within
the limits of the IC~348 cluster. An upper limit on the extinction was
estimated for each candidate from colour-magnitude diagrams, and found
consistent with extinction maps of the cloud. Initial comparisons with
T-dwarf spectral models suggest these candidates have a spectral type
between T3 and T5, and perhaps later, potentially making these among
the lowest mass isolated objects detected in a young star forming
region so far.

Introduction

In the framework of the EU Marie Curie network ``Constellation : the
origin of stellar masses'', we conducted a deep imaging survey of the
star forming region IC~348 with the
aim to find isolated planetary mass objects, with a mass of a
few M_Jup, and constrain the low mass end of the Initial Mass
Function. Deep, wide-field broad-band zJHK and narrow-band CH4
on/off images were obtained at CFHT. Image analysis focused on faint
source detection, and a number of photometric tests were conducted to
ensure good photometric reliability and completeness down to
K 19.5~mag.

Selection of methane candidates

CH_4off (1.58 ) and CH_4on (1.69 ) narrowband
filters were used to detect methane absorption bands that develop in
the atmosphere of the coolest (T 1200K) objects, the
so-called T-dwarfs (cf. Fig.~). We convolved observed
low resolution spectra of field L1-T8 dwarfs with MEGACAM/WIRCAM
filters in order to compute the expected CH_4on-CH_4off
colours as a function of spectral type. The results are shown in
Figure~, with the L/T dwarf transition occurring at
CH_4on-CH_4off 0.1~mag for field dwarfs.

Stellar-like objects were detected on the deep CH_4off image and
PSF photometry was applied to both the CH_4on and CH_4off
images. In order to conservatively account for the photometric error,
we selected T-dwarf candidates as having
CH_4on--CH_4off~ ~0.4~mag, which corresponds to a
spectral type of about T3 or later (cf. Fig.~). With this
selection limit, 135 T-dwarf candidates were initially selected. Only
4 remained, however, after visual inspection of the candidates on the
images, the other 131 being image artefacts (cross-talk, bad pixels,
etc). The 4 T-dwarf candidates are shown in a CH_4on-CH_4off
versus CH_4off diagram (Fig.~), along with all the
other stellar-like objects detected in the images. Cand-3589 remained
undetected on the CH_4on image and has been plotted using the
CH_4on detection limit ( 22.5~mag). The 4 candidates stand
out in this diagram at 4 or more above the rms photometric
error (0.12 mag), as measured by the dispersion of the background population in
the same magnitude bin.

Properties of candidate T-dwarfs

An estimate of the extinction towards each candidate is required to
derive their absolute magnitude and, using model isochrones, mass. An
upper limit on the extinction was obtained from the J versus (J-H)
diagram shown in Figure~ by projecting the candidates back
onto the COND isochrone. The results are summarised in Table
and concur with extinction maps of IC 348 by
and which
indicate 4 _V 20~mag for cloud members. Table
also lists the candidates magnitude and their spectral
type estimated from Figure~. Note, however, that the
spectral classification is uncertain, as the comparison between IC~348
methane dwarfs and much older field T-dwarfs in Fig.~
assumes that their widely different gravity does not impact on their
methane colours.

Cloud Membership

The probability of one of the candidates being a foreground field
T-dwarf projected against the cloud instead of being a bona fide
IC~348 member can be estimated from the expected number density of
T3-5.5 dwarfs in the solar neighourhood, 1 per 740~pc^-3
. The footprint of the CH_4 image is
0.11~deg^2, which at the distance of IC~348 ( 340pc)
equates to less than one expected foreground T3-T5.5 dwarf in the
corresponding volume. Background field T-dwarfs cannot contaminate our
sample either as, at a distance of 340~pc or more, they would be at
least 1 mag fainter than our candidates in the K-band, even neglecting
extinction. Furthermore, 3 of our 4 candidates lie within 7^
of the cluster centre (cf. Table~1), the half-mass radius of which is
5^ . We conclude that at least 3 of the 4 proposed T-dwarf
candidates are probable IC 348 members, with a mass of a few jupiter
masses according to theoretical models at an age of 3~Myr.

Conclusion

We report the detection of 4 methane dwarf candidates in the young
star forming region IC~348. We tentatively estimate a spectral type
in the range T3-T5 or even later, which would make these candidates
amongst the least massive isolated objects ever detected in a star
forming region. Although follow up observations are clearly needed,
spectroscopic confirmation will be difficult owing to the faintness of
the candidates.
