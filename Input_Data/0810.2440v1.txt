abstract

The Kepler mission's primary goal is the detection
and characterization of Earth-like planets by observing continuously
a region of
sky for a nominal period of three-and-a-half years.
Over 100,000 stars will be monitored, with a small subset of these
having a cadence of 1 minute, making asteroseismic studies for many
stars possible.
The subset of targets will consist of mainly solar-type and
planet-hosting stars, and these will be observed for a minimum
period of 1 month and a maximum depending on the scientific yield
of the individual target.
Many oscillation frequencies will be detected in these data,
and these will be used to constrain the star's fundamental parameters.

I investigate
the effect that an increase in a) the length of observation
and b) the signal quality, has on the final determination of
some stellar
global parameters, such as the radius and the age.

Method
Precision of oscillation frequencies
The Kepler mission will yield high-cadence
photometric time series for many
hundreds to a few thousands of oscillating solar-type stars.
By using any method to extract periodic signals in these light curves, for
example an FFT or a least-squares fit to sinusoids, the
pulsation frequencies
or oscillation modes will be detectable.
The number of frequencies detected for each star

will depend primarily on the intrinsic brightness
of the star, its distance and the characteristics of its oscillation modes.

Consequently, the errors associated with each of the detected frequencies also
depends on these characteristics.
For data analysis purposes, however, we can quantify the error on each
frequency _ as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the
power spectrum,
the duration of observation T and the natural linewidth of the
frequency (related to the damping rate of the oscillations).
lib91 gives a formula for the estimation of these errors:

_ ^2 = f( ) 4 T

where is the inverse of the SNR and varies usually between 0.1 - 1.0.

Determining the constraints on global parameters
In order to determine the global parameters (and subsequently the
internal structure)
of a star, one needs to compare a set of model observables B
to a set of observations O.
We use a stellar structure and evolution code ASTEC
, coupled to an adiabatic oscillation code ADIPLS
.
This model takes a set of input parameters P and generates a stellar
model based on P. The expected observables B can be
consequently calculated (L_ , magnitudes, mean density ...).
One form of determining the stellar global parameters (these are the P)
is to incorporate some
algorithm that minimizes the discrepancies between the model observables and
the observations,
and then use
a value (such as ^2) to quantify the fit to the data:

^2 = _i=1^M (O_i - B_i)^2 _i^2,

for each i = 1,...,M observation and
_i represents the errors on each of the O_i.

Once we find a robust fit to the data, we can use the following formula
to calculate the uncertainties in each of the model parameters:

_j^2 = _k=1^N V_jk^2W_kk^2

for each j = 1, ..., N model parameter.
Here, V_k and W_k are
the k^ th components of the singular value decomposition of the matrix
D, whose elements D_ij
are given by B_i P_j / _i
.

Here we can see that the uncertainties in the parameters such as mass, radius
and age come from the sensitivity of each of the observables with respect to
each of the parameters (from models),
and the associated error on each of these
measurements. These quantities can change by
itemize
including more measurements, such as classical
observations (T_ eff, g, Z/X) or more oscillation
frequencies
studying a star at various evolutionary
stages, because the measurement sensitivities
to each of the parameters changes as the stellar structure changes

varying the expected errors on the measurements .
itemize
In the first subsection we discussed the frequency errors and their
dependencies on the photometric time series.
Here we translate these into uncertainties in the global parameters of
radius and age as a function of quality of data and duration of observations.


Results
We show in Figures and the expected
uncertainties in the radius and the age,
respectively, of a 1 M_ star as
a function of signal quality.
We have quantified signal quality as (SNR, NF) where
the 'signal' in SNR refers to the amplitude of the highest
peak in the spectrum, and the 'noise' refers to the noise level
around this peak.
NF is the number of detected frequencies
for each oscillation mode l = 0 and 1
i.e. NF = 3 means 3 l = 0 modes and 3 l = 1 modes.

If a star has a SNR of 10, then it is most likely that the
number of detected frequencies (NF) in the power spectrum is
higher than a star whose SNR = 2.
For this reason we may assume that both the SNR and NF increase together.
These are the numbers on the x-axis in each graph:
e.g. (SNR, NF) = (2, 3), (4, 5) etc.

Both figures also show the uncertainties in the radius and the age assuming
various lengths of observation.
The various colour curves represent data of a specific time span
of high-cadence 100\
red, yellow, green and blue indicate respectively, 1 month, 3 months,
9 months and 12 months of observational data to extract the oscillation
frequencies.

Conclusions
itemize
The stellar radius can be determined to within 2-3\
M_ star for all combinations of signal quality and observation
length studied.

Observing a star that has at least 5 detected frequencies for l=0
and l=1 modes yields ( ) <20\
and requiring that
the length of observation is at least 3 months, improves this to better than
12\

The most significant improvements in (R) and ( ) come
from extending a data set from 1 month to 3 months.
If the data set spans 9 months, then extending it will result in
very little improvement in these quantities.

A star observed for 1 month requires a minumum (SNR, NF) = (6, 7)
to constrain adequately the radius and the age of a 1 M_ ;
3 months requires a minimum (SNR, NF) = (4, 5);
9 months requires a minimum (SNR,~NF)~=~(2,~3).
