abstract
Conventional astrophysical observations have failed to provide stringent constraints on physical processes operating in the interior of the stars. However, satellite missions now promise a solution to these problems by providing long-term high-quality continuous data which will allow the application of seismic techniques. With this in mind, and using the Sun as our astrophysical laboratory, our aim is to determine if Corot- and Kepler-like asteroseismic data can constrain physical processes like microscopic diffusion. We test to what extent can the observed atmospheric abundances coupled with p-mode frequencies safely distinguish between stellar initial chemical composition and diffusion of these elements. We present some preliminary results of our analysis.

Introduction \& Method

If we have the following observations for a solar-type star:
a set of p-mode frequencies, measured abundances, and an identified g mode,
we can investigate how these observations may constrain some of the
physical processes occuring in the interior of a star.
Suppose that the stellar model is a main sequence 1 M_ star, and that
we can calibrate the age of the star using the radius and luminosity.
Then the free parameters that remain to be fitted in the star are
the initial mass fractions of hydrogen and metals X_0 and Z_0,
and the velocities of diffusion of these elements V_X, V_Y and V_Z,
(assuming that other microscopic processes may not be ``observable''),
where Y denotes helium.
Let's denote these set of parameters as P.
Using P we can calculate a stellar model which will give us
the expected observables, B (expected p-mode frequencies,
abundances etc.).

If we have a set of observations O, then
in order to find the P that most adequately reproduce
O, we can use the following equation iteratively, until we
make O as close as possible to B:

P = V W^-1 U O - B
.

P are the parameter corrections to make
to the initial guess P_0, are the
measurement errors, and UWV^T is the singular value decomposition of
the sensitivity matrix, which can be written as
B P/ and
W^-1 has some zero values to stabilize the inversion
(see ).

Once P have been found,

then the
theoretical uncertainties ( P)
can be calculated for each j = 1, 2, ... N parameter


_j^2( P) = _k^N V_jk^2 W_k^2.


The partial derivatives were calculated using the CESAM code
Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire
and ADIPLS .
We took the standard solar model as a reference using the
abundances of gn93, and calibrated these models
in radius and luminosity
to an accuracy of 10^-2 as described in mat07.
The reference parameters for the models are (X_0, Z_0) = (0.708, 0.0195)
and (V_X, V_Y, V_Z) = (2.307, -7.063, -5.635) 10^-9 cm s^-1.

Results and Discussion

Impact of each observable on the uncertainties
Using only p-mode frequencies to determine the parameter uncertainties
(using Eq.~) the diffusion coefficients V_X, V_Y and V_Z
can not be disentangled.
Their uncertainties remain too large
(189\
have only these
observations with errors of the order of 1.3 ,
meanwhile the values for (X_0) and (Z_0) are 3\
However, to show the effect that each of the observations has on the
determination of the parameters,
Figure 1 shows how the uncertainties in each of the parameters reduce
relative to these values,
as extra observables such as abundances and
g modes are included.
Each of the bars represents from left to right the following
additions to the set of observations:
itemize
Blue reduce the errors on the p-mode frequencies by almost a factor of 2 (from 1.3 –-- 0.7 )
Green include abundance measurements of He, C, N and O
Yellow include abundance measurements of Li and Be
( = 0.1 dex for all abundances)
Red include 1 identified g mode
	 itemize
After including all of these observations, the final parameter
uncertainties are: 1\

It is interesting to note the various effects of adding in new observables.
Firstly, reducing all of the uncertainties by almost a factor of 2 should
result in a corresponding reduction in the uncertainties by this same amount.
The blue bars clearly indicate that this is the case.
When we include the abundance measurements of
He, C, N, O with an observational error of 0.1 dex, the uncertainties
in both X_0 and Z_0 reduce by almost a factor of two (green).
These same abundances have little effect for constraining the diffusion
velocities.
However, including Be and Li measurements has a significant impact on the
determination of the metal diffusion velocity V_Z (yellow),
reducing its uncertainty
to 72\
Finally, the inclusion of one identified g mode has most impact on
constraining V_X and then V_Y (red).

Recovery of original parameters
The final uncertainties may be sufficiently low that the observations
do contain enough information to be able to distinguish safely between
initial metal mass fraction Z_0 and diffusion of this V_Z
(our original scientific question).
Assume that we have two new sets of observations, and that these O
really come from a solar model with 1) lower Z_0 and 2) lower V_Z.
If we use Eq.~ to fit the new O (separately) while

using the reference set of parameters as P_0 (the initial
guess),
we will obtain non-zero negative values
of Z_0 and V_Z respectively,
only if the observations contain sufficient information.

If there is not enough information contained in the observations,
then Z_0 V_Z 0.

Figure shows the values of
(relative to the original value of P, for scaling purposes)
for some of the parameters of the models, when attempting to fit a set
of observations generated from a model with a reduced Z_0 (red) and
a reduced V_Z (blue).
As the figure shows, some non-zero are needed
to account for the new observations.

itemize
When inverting using the lower Z_0 model observations (red),
Z_0 is negative.
This means that we need to reduce the original Z_0 value to a lower
one --- consistent with the input model.
However, we also see a negative contribution to V_Z;
ideally V_Z would not change, because it was not changed in this model,
just as X_0 does not change.
When inverting using the lower V_Z model observations (blue),
we obtain a much more negative
V_Z (but no change in Z_0),
indicating a necessary downward revision of only V_Z ---
consistent with the input model.
itemize

These results are preliminary, but encouraging:
there is some indication in the set of observables that we may be
able to distinguish between initial metal abundance and
diffusion of this using abundance measurements and seismic data.
