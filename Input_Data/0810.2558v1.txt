Context: The discovery of multiple main sequences (MS) in the
massive clusters NGC~2808 and Omega Centauri, and multiple subgiant
branches in NGC~1851 and NGC~6388 has challenged the long-held
paradigm that globular clusters consist of simple stellar populations.
This evolving picture has been further complicated by recent
photometric studies of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
intermediate-age clusters, where the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) was
found to be bimodal (NGC~1806 and NGC~1846) or broadened (NGC~1783 and
NGC~2173).

Aims: We have undertaken a study of archival HST images of Large
and Small Magellanic Cloud clusters with the aim of measuring the
frequency of clusters with evidence of multiple or prolonged star
formation events and determining their main properties. We found
useful images for 53
clusters that cover a wide range of ages. In
this paper, we analyse the Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMD) of sixteen
intermediate-age ( 1-3 Gyr) LMC clusters.

Methods: The data were reduced by using the method developed by
Anderson et al. (2008) and the photometry has been corrected for
differential reddening (where required). We find that eleven clusters
show an anomalous spread (or split) in color and magnitude around the
MSTO, even though the other main features of the CMD (MS, red giant
branch, asymptotic giant branch) are narrow and the horizontal branch
(HB) red-clump well defined. By using the CMD of the stars in regions
that surround the cluster, we demonstrate that the observed feature is
unequivocally associated to the clusters. We use artificial-star
tests to demonstrate that the spread (or split) is not an artifact due
to photometric errors or binaries.

Results: We confirm that two clusters (NGC~1806 and NGC~1846)
clearly exhibit two distinct MSTOs and observe, for the first time, a
double MSTO in NGC~1751. In these three clusters the population
corresponding to the brighter MSTO includes more than two-thirds of
cluster stellar population. We confirm the presence of multiple
stellar populations in NGC~1783. Our photometry strongly suggests
that the MSTO of this cluster is formed by two distinct branches. In
seven clusters (ESO057-SC075, HODGE7, NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1987,
NGC~2108, and NGC~2154) we observed an intrinsic broadening of the
MSTO that may suggest that these clusters have experienced a prolonged
period of star formation that span a period between 150 and 250 Myr.
The CMDs of IC~2146, NGC~1644, NGC~1652, NGC~1795 and NGC~1978 show no
evidence of spread or bimodality within our photometric precision. In
summary 70 25\

Multiple stellar populations in Large Magellanic Cloud clusters
Milone et al.


Introduction

Nearly all the clusters that have been resolved into individual stars
exhibit a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) consistent with the stars
belonging to a single, simple stellar population. In recent years,
however, thanks to the improving precision of instruments and
techniques (mainly from space), the discovery of multiple populations
of stars in stellar clusters is challenging this traditional picture
and has led to new views on how clusters form and evolve.

Thus far, photometry has revealed multiple stellar populations in a
few Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs) i. e. Omega Centauri (Anderson
1997, Bedin et al.\ 2004, Piotto et al.\ 2005, Sollima et al.\ 2007,
Villanova et al.\ 2007), NGC~2808 (D'Antona et al.\ 2005, Piotto et
al.\ 2007), NGC~1851 (Milone et al.\ 2008), and NGC~6388 (Piotto 2008),
also in some intermediate-age Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters
(Bertelli et al.\ 2003, Mackey \& Broby Nielsen \ 2007 [M07], Mackey
et al.\ 2008 [M08])
and in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) cluster NGC~419 (Glatt et al \ 2008a).
Each of the above clusters exhibits a different
pattern of age spread and/or chemical enrichment. It is clear that
the star-formation history differs from cluster to cluster (see
Piotto\ 2008 for a review).

There is additional photometric evidence that other clusters exhibit
some kind of population multiplicity. Marino et al.\ (2008) found
photometric evidence of two distinct stellar populations among the
red giant branch (RGB) stars of M4. Yong et al.\ (2008) find
abundance variations in NGC~6752 that correlate with the Str omgren
cy index, and show eight other clusters that present a similar cy
spread in their giant branches.

In addition, many GGCs, including those with no photometric evidence
for multiple populations, exhibit large star-to-star variations in
their chemical abundances (see Gratton et al. 2004 for a review).
Almost all GGCs have homogeneous Fe-peak-element abundances (with the
only exception being Omega Centauri, hereafter ~Cen), but they
show a significant dispersion in CNO, Na, Mg, Al and s-process
elements. The pattern of chemical abundances in GGCs must be
primordial as it is observed not only among RGB or asimptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars, but also among the sub giant branch (SGB), and
most importantly among unevolved stars on the MS
(Gratton et al.\ 2001, 2004). The presence of a well defined pattern
among Na, O, Mg, and Al suggests that most of the GGCs may have hosted
multiple episodes of star formation separated by few hundred Myrs
(D'Antona \& Caloi, 2008).

Unfortunately, in an old population, such a difference in age
corresponds to a difference of few hundredths of a magnitude at the
level of the MS turn-off (TO) and SGB. At the
moment it is not possible to firmly establish the presence of a spread
in a cluster's MSTO with this amplitude given the presence of
differential reddening and difficulties in doing systematically
accurate crowded-field photometry at this level of precision.

The families of young and intermediate-age massive clusters that
populate the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud

offer us
precious opportunities to photometrically search for multiple stellar
populations because, in the CMD of a 1-3 Gyr old cluster, an age
interval of 200-300 Myr corresponds to a magnitude difference of a few
tenths of a magnitude. Two populations with such a difference could
easily be distinguished even at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds
(MC).

Indeed, recent photometric studies of LMC clusters have demonstrated
that the presence of multiple stellar populations is not a peculiarity
of the most massive Galactic GGCs. Bertelli et al.\ (2003) have
compared a CMD of NGC~2173 from FORS/VLT data with Padova models and
suggested for this LMC cluster a prolonged star-formation episode
spanning a period of about 300Myr. In a recent paper, M08 found
that the main-sequence turn off (MSTO) for NGC~1783 reveals a much
larger spread in color than can be explained by photometric errors.
M07 and M08 also revealed the presence of a double MSTO in the rich
intermediate-age clusters NGC~1846 and NGC~1806 of the LMC, and
suggested that their CMDs unveil the presence of two populations with
an age difference of 300~Myr.

Driven by these results on
Galactic and LMC clusters, we have undertaken an analysis of archival
HST images of LMC and SMC clusters with the purpose of measuring the
frequency of clusters with evidence of multiple or prolonged star
formation. The clusters that have been analysed cover a wide range of
ages, from 10^6 to 10^10 yr. Since the search of
multiple populations is carried out through analysis of CMDs,
the study of clusters with different ages requires different analysis.

In this paper, which is the first of a series, we show our entire
sample of ACS/WFC CMDs for forty-seven LMC and SMC stellar clusters
and present a detailed study of sixteen intermediate-age LMC clusters
(between 1and 3Gyr). The paper is organized as follow.
Section~ describes the data and the data reduction
techniques. In Section~ we present the CMDs of the
sixteen intermediate-age clusters. In Section~4, we confirm the split
of the MSTO of NGC~1806 and NGC~1846, and observe, for the first time,
two distinct MSTOs in NGC~1751. We analyse in details the CMD of these
clusters and measure the fraction of stars belonging to each of their
MSTO populations. We confirm the presence of multiple stellar
populations in NGC~1783 and suggest that the MSTO of this cluster
should be formed by two distinct branches. In Section 5 we note an
anomalous spread around the MSTO of seven clusters: ESO057-SC075,
HODGE~7, NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1987, NGC~2108, and NGC~2154. In
Section~6 we demonstrate that the observed spread in the MSTO region
of these clusters must be real, as it cannot be due to differential
reddening, field contamination, photometric errors or binary stars. In
Section~ we determine the cluster ages and the age
differences among different stellar populations in the same cluster
through isochrone fitting. Finally, Section~
includes a short summary of our results.

Observation and data reduction

In order to investigate the presence of multiple stellar populations
in Magellanic Cloud clusters we searched the MAST STScI-archive for
HST images collected with the Wide Field Channel (WFC) of the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (hereafter ACS/WFC). We found useful
images for 53 clusters
from GO~9891 (PI: G. F. Gilmore ),
GO~10395 (PI: J. S. Gallagher) and GO~10595 (PI: P. Goudfrooij). The
result of this search is presented in Tab.~1 for 47 clusters from
GO~9891 and GO~10595, while the GO~10396 data-set described in
Table 1 of Glatt et al. (2008b) (which includes six SMC clusters)
will be used in a future paper focused on SMC.

The photometric reduction of the ACS/WFC data has been carried out
using the software presented and described in detail in Anderson et
al.\ (2008). It consists in a package that analyses all the exposures
of each cluster simultaneously in order to generate a single list of
stars for each field. Stars are measured independently in each image
by using the best available PSF models from Anderson \& King (2006).

This routine was designed to work well in both crowded and uncrowded
fields and it is able to detect almost every star that can be detected
by eye. It takes advantage of the many independent dithered pointings of
each scene and the knowledge of the PSF to avoid including artifacts
in the list. Calibration of ACS photometry into the Vega-mag system
has been performed following recipes in Bedin et al.\ (2005) and using
the zero points given in Sirianni et al.\ (2005).

Selection of a sample of best measured stars

Stars can be poorly measured for several reasons: crowding by nearby
neighbours, contamination by cosmic-rays (CRs) or image artifacts such
as hot pixels or diffraction spikes. The goal of the present work is
to clearly identify multi-populations. For this purpose we need to
select the best-measured stars in the field (i.e., those with the lowest
random and systematic errors), but we also need to have a large enough
statistical sample to be able to identify secondary sequences that may
have many fewer members than the primary ones.

The software presented by Anderson et al.\ (2008) provides very
valuable tools to reach this goal. In addition to the stellar fluxes
and positions it provides a number of parameters that can be used as
diagnostics of the reliability of photometric measurements.
Specifically these are:

itemize
the rms of the magnitudes measured in different exposures
(rms_m_ F435W, rms_m_ F555W, and rms_m_
F814W, available only for clusters with more than one exposure in the
same filter, cfr. Tab.~1);
the rms of the positions measured in
different exposures transformed in a common distortion-free
reference frames (rms_ X, and rms_ Y);
the residuals to the PSF fit for each star (q_m_ F435W,
q_m_ F555W, and q_m_ F814W; this is what Anderson et al.\ 2008,
define as quality fit);
the ratio between the estimated flux of the star in a 0.5 arcsec
aperture, and the flux from neighboring stars within the same
aperture (o_m_ F435W, o_m_ F555W, and o_m_
F814W, again see Anderson et al.\ 2008 for details).
itemize

We used these parameters to select a sub-sample of stars with the best
photometry.

In the five left panels of Fig.~, we show the criteria
that we have used to select the sample of stars with the best
photometry in the F435W band for NGC~1806. The photometric system at
this stage is kept in instrumental magnitudes, -2.5
log_10( flux), where the flux is expressed in photo-electrons
recorded in the reference exposure.

We note a clear trend of the quality-fit and rms parameters as a
function of the magnitude due to the decreasing signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N). In order to select well-measured stars at different S/N we
adopted the following procedure.

We began by dividing all the stars into magnitude bins. The size of
each bin varied from one cluster to another depending on the number of
stars; for each of them, we computed the median rms (q) and the
68.27^ th percentile (hereafter ). The median was
derived recursively: after each computation, all stars exceeding four
times were provisionally rejected until the next iteration
and the median was recomputed. This procedure was repeated until two
subsequent measures of the median differ by less than the 1\
value.

Finally, we arrived at the red line of Fig.~ by adding
to the median of each bin N times . This gave us the red
circles, which we then fitted with a spline. All stars below the red
line in each plot have been flagged as well-measured. The factor N
ranges from 5 to 6, and has been chosen in order to draw the
boundaries that follow the bulk of the distribution of each parameter
value.

The neighbour-contamination parameters do not show a clear trend with
magnitude, so we simply flagged as well-measured all the stars with
o_m_ F435W,~F555W,~F814W<5.

Obviously, the rms of the
magnitudes was not available in the case of clusters with only one
image per band (HODGE~7, IC~2146, NGC~1644, NGC~1652, NGC~1795,
NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1978, and NGC~2154). In such cases those
selections were not applied.

In the right panels of Fig.~ we show the CMD of all the
measured stars of NGC~1806 (top) and of stars that pass all the
selection criteria (bottom).



Artificial-star tests

The artificial-star (AS) experiments used in this paper have been run
following the procedures described in Anderson et al.\ (2008).

First of all, for each cluster, we produced an input list with about
10^5 stars located on the entire ACS field of view. It includes the
coordinates of the stars (X_ in, Y_ in) in the reference
frame, and the magnitudes in the F435W (or F555W) and F814W bands
(mv_ in, mi_ in ). We generated the artificial stars
with a flat luminosity function in the F814W band and with
instrumental magnitudes from -5 to -14. We placed artificial
stars fainter than the MSTO on the MS ridge line that is determined as
described in section and added artificial stars
brighter than the MSTO along the isochrone that best fits the observed
CMD (see section ).

The program described in Anderson et al.\ (2008) allows
artificial-star tests to be performed for one star at a time and
entirely in software guaranting that artificial stars will never
interfere with each other, no matter how many tests are done.
Therefore it makes very simple to do artificial star tests because it
is not necessary to add an array of non-interfering stars on the
images, reducing all the images each time. For each star in the input
list, the routine adds the star to each exposure at the appropriate
place with the appropriate flux, and measures the images in the same
manner as real stars, producing the same output parameters as in
section . If the input and the output positions differ
by less than 0.5 pixel and the fluxes differ by less than 0.75
magnitudes, than the artificial star is considered as found.

Artificial stars played a crucial role in this analysis; they allowed
us to determine the completeness level of our sample and to measure
the fraction of chance-superposition ``binaries''. The completeness
depends on the crowding conditions as well as on stellar luminosity.
Our procedures account for both of these.
Our goal in the AS tests is to probe how incompleteness and
photometric errors vary with crowding or brightness. So, we generated
a list of artificial stars that had colors that placed them on the
average cluster sequence and positions drawn from the overall cluster
radial distribution.

We divided the ACS/WFC field for each cluster into 5 concentric annuli
centered on the cluster center, and within each annulus we examined
the AS results in eight magnitude bins, from -14 to -5. For each
of these 5 8 grid points, we then determined the average
completeness by taking the ratio of the recovered to input artificial
stars within that bin. This grid then allowed us to estimate the
completeness for any star at any position within the cluster. As an
example, the left panel of Fig.~ shows the completeness as
a function of the instrumental m_ F814W magnitude in each of
the five annuli we used to divide the field of NGC~1806. Finally, we
interpolated the grid points and derived the completeness value
associated with each star. The right panel of Fig.~ shows
the completeness contours in the radius versus m_ F814W
magnitude plane. Continuous lines correspond to completeness levels of
0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. Dotted lines indicate differences of completeness
of 0.05.

The cluster CMDs

In Fig.~ we show the instrumental m_ F555W
versus m_ F555W-m_ F814W CMDs of all the 47 clusters
from GO~9891 and GO~10595
presented in Section~. It is clear from this figure that
our sample contains clusters at many different stages of
evolution. This paper will deal with the CMDs of the sixteen
intermediate-age clusters (from 1 to 3 Gyr). The other
clusters will be covered in forthcoming papers. All selected
intermediate age clusters are LMC members.

Most of the CMDs plotted in Fig.~ show considerable
evidence of contamination, mainly due to MC field stars. For the
purposes of this paper, it is crucial to determine as well as possible
the stellar distribution in the field-star CMD, since without such
attention, field sequences could be erroneously attributed to the
cluster and interpreted as an additional population.

Since most of the clusters of our sample cover a small portion of the
ACS/WFC field of view, we can easily isolate a CMD that is
representative of the field population surrounding the cluster by
selecting the portion of the ACS/WFC image that are most distant from
the cluster center, so that the contamination of cluster members
should be negligible and, in many cases, almost absent.

In order to minimize the fraction of field stars in the cluster CMD,
we selected two regions with the same area. The first region, which
below we will call the 'cluster field', is centered on the cluster and
includes the region with the highest density of cluster members (with
the only exception of NGC~1978, where we chose an annulus around the
cluster center in order to exclude the crowded cluster core). The
second region is far enough from the cluster center that very few
cluster stars would be expected to be present there. We will call this
field 'reference field' and its stars should be representative of the
typical population in front of and behind the cluster. Since cluster
stars in the vicinity of the MSTO are the main target of the present
study, we defined the area of these regions such that the density of
stars within a magnitude from the TO, namely with m_
F814W<(m_ F814W^ TO+1), in the cluster field would be at
least a fixed number (N) of times that of the reference field. In
most cases we could set N=5, which would mean that even without
field correction, we have at most a 20\
is NGC~1917 which is projected upon a densely populated region of the
LMC. In this case we used N=3. For the most populated clusters
(IC~2146, NGC~1806, NGC~1846, and NGC~1978) we adopted N=10.

In Fig.~, we compare the CMDs of the cluster and reference
fields for the sixteen intermediate age clusters that have been
studied in this paper.

reference fields for the 16 selected intermediate-age clusters.

All the reference-field CMDs selected with this criterion share a
broadened, young main sequence and a 5-6 Gyr old stellar population
that departs from the MS at around m_ F555W=22.5 and populate
the evolved portions of the CMD. In Sec.~
we will use the CMDs of the reference field to decontaminate the CMD
of the cluster.

Differential reddening
It is well known that differential reddening causes a shift of all the
CMD features parallel to the reddening line and tends to randomly
broaden them. A quick look at the CMDs presented in this paper shows
that most of the RGBs and AGBs are narrow and well defined, and that
the HB red-clump is compact. Moreover, we have divided the cluster field
into many subregions (the exact number varies from one cluster to
another, depending on the number of stars) and compared the CMDs of
stars located in each of them. In most cases, we found no evidence for
an offset among the CMDs and therefore, any variations of reddening
should be negligible.

Two exceptions to this reddening-free rule are NGC~1751 and NGC~2108.
We show their CMD in Fig.~ and . The confused
shape of the HB red-clumps and of other primary features suggests the
presence of differential reddening. Since differential reddening acts
along the direction of the reddening arrow shown at the lower left,
sequences (such as the SGB) that are aligned perpendicular to the
reddening line are most affected.





For this reason, a search for a possible split or a spread around the
MSTO requires an accurate correction of the effects produced by
differential reddening on the observed CMD. In order to correct for
differential reddening, we have used the procedure described in
Sarajedini et al.\ (2007). Briefly: we define the fiducial main
sequence for the cluster and tabulate, at a grid of points across the
field, how the observed stars in the vicinity of each grid point may
systematically lie to the red or the blue of the fiducial sequence;
this systematic color offset is indicative of the local differential
reddening.

In the lower panel of Fig.~, we show the corrected CMD of
NGC~1751. It should be noted how, after the correction has been
applied, all the main features of the CMD become
narrower and clearly defined, confirming that most of the effects of
differential reddening have been removed. The improvement of the CMD
is particularly evident for the stars of the HB red-clump; the tightness
along the reddening line of this clump means that
the spread (or split) we see in the MSTO cannot be due to differential
reddening. Figure~ illustrates the effects of the
reddening correction in NGC 2108. The total amount of differential
reddening within the cluster region is E(F435W-F814W)=0.10
for NGC~1751 and E(F435W-F814W)=0.08 for NGC~2108.

The two clusters that suffer of a sizable differential reddening are
not at any particular angular distance from the center of the LMC,
or with respect to the Milky Way, compared to the other forteen clusters.
They might just fall in some gas-dust complex structure poorly known,
and/or with a limited spatial extension.

Clusters with a double MSTO: NGC~1806, NGC~1846 and NGC~1751

At least three clusters of our sample clearly show two distinct
MSTOs:\ NGC~1846, NGC~1806, and NGC~1751. The split is evident in the
CMDs of the cluster fields that are shown in Fig.~,
and , and is exalted by the Hess diagram in
the inset. The presence of two, distinct TOs in NGC~1806 and NGC~1846
was discovered by M07 and M08, who also found no difference in the
spatial distribution between the stars in the brighter and fainter
MSTOs (hereafter bMSTO and fMSTO).







In this work, we take advantage from the high photometric quality of
our CMDs to measure the fraction of stars belonging to each turnoff
population. To do this, it is necessary to select and compare the two
groups of bMSTO and fMSTO.

This procedure is illustrated in Fig.~ for NGC~1806.
We used the CMD of the cluster field, with foreground/background
contamination removed as described in Section 6.1. We began by
finding the isochrones that went through the two sequences and the
giant branch (as it will be described in details in
section~). These are the red and the blue lines. We
then defined by hand two pairs of reference points: P_1,f and
P_2,f on the fMSTO isochrone and P_1,b and P_2,b on the
bMSTO isochrone. The two pairs of points have been chosen with the
criterion of delimiting the region of the CMD where the split is more
evident and have been used to draw the grey lines in panel (a). Only
stars contained in the region between these lines have been used for
the following analysis.

In panel (b), we have shifted and rotated the reference frame such
that the new origin corresponds to P_1,f and the abscissa goes
from P_1,b to P_1,f. For simplicity, in the following, we
will refer to the abscissa and ordinate of this reference frame as
'color' and 'magnitude'. The red dashed line is a fiducial line
through the region close to the fMSTO. We drew it by marking on the
region close to the fMSTO four points, equally spaced in 'magnitude'
and drawing, a line through them by means of a spline fit.

In panel (c) the 'color' of this line has been subtracted from the
color of each star, and the 'magnitude' of each star has been divided
by the 'magnitude' of a stars with the same 'color' that lie on the
line that goes from P_1,f to P_1,b.

For the analysis that follows, we have divided the 'magnitude' range
into N bins. We used N=4 for NGC~1806 and NGC~1846 and N=2 for
the less populated NGC~1751. In each of them, we have determined the
fraction of stars belonging to each MSTO as follows. Our aim was to
model the 'color' distribution by fitting the sum of two
partially overlapping gaussians, but we need to reduce the influence
of outliers (such as stars with poor photometry, residual field stars
and binaries). To this end, we did a preliminary fit of the gaussians
using all available stars, then we rejected all the stars distant more
than two _b from the bMSTO and less than 2 _f from the
fMSTO and repeated the fit (where the 's are those of the best
fitting gaussians in each 'magnitude' bin fitted to the fMSTO and
bMSTO respectively).

The continuous vertical lines show the centers of the best-fitting
gaussians in each 'magnitude' interval. The red dashed line
is located two _f on the "blue" side of the fMSTO and the
blue line runs two _b on the "red" side of the bMSTO,

figure*[ht!]

[width= ]f10.ps
This figure illustrates the procedure adopted to
measure the fraction of stars belonging to the bMSTO and fMSTO
in NGC~1806. Panel (a) shows a zoom of the CMD from
Fig.~ with the isochrones that best fits the
fMSTO and the bMSTO overimposed. The grey lines delimit the
portion of the CMD where the split is more evident. Only stars
from this region are used to measure the population ratio. In
Panel (b) we shifted and rotated the reference frame of Panel
(a). Red dashed line is the fiducial of the region around the
fMSTO. In Panel (c) we plotted stars between the grey lines
but after the subtraction of the 'color' of the region around
the fMSTO fiducial from the 'color' of each star and the
division of the 'magnitude' of each star by the 'magnitude' of
the upper grey line. The four right bottom panels show the
'color' distribution for stars in four
'magnitude' bins. The solid lines represent a
bigaussian fit. For each bin, the dispersions of the best
fitting gaussians are indicated.


figure*

It is important to notice here that, to each point (P_1,f(b),
P_2,f(b)) that we have arbitrarely selected on the two isochrones
with the only purpose of disentangle the two SGBs, corresponds a mass
(M_P1f(b), M_P2f(b)). In order to obtain a more correct
measure of the fraction of stars in each of the two population
(f_bMSTO, f_fMSTO) it must be noted that we are dealing with
two different mass intervals (M_P2f-M_P1f M_P2b-M_P1b)
and we have to compensate for two facts: first, more massive stars are
more rare, and second, more massive stars evolve faster.

We calculated the fraction of stars in each branch as:
center
f_bMSTO = A_b N_b/N_f A_f +
A_b N_b/N_f
f_fMSTO = A_f A_f + A_b N_b/N_f
center
where A_b and A_f are the area of the gaussians that best fit
the bMSTO and the fMSTO, and N_f(b)= _P_1,f(b)^P_2,F(b)
(M)dM, being adopting for (M)
the Salpeter (1955) IMF.

We find that 74 4 \
26 4\
of stars in the bMSTO and 25 3 \
\
the fMSTO. Interestingly enough, a similar population ratio
between the bright and the faint SGB ratios has been found in the
Galactic globular clusters NGC 1851 (Milone et al.\ 2008) and NGC 6388
(Piotto et al, in preparation). We note here that D'Antona and Coloi (2008) predict
that more than 50\
second (younger) population in their intermediate mass AGB ejecta
pollution scenario proposed to explain multiple populations in star
clusters.

The (double ?) MSTO of NGC~1783.



A spread in color around the MSTO of NGC~1783 was first noted by
Mucciarelli et al.\ (2007). Unfortunately their m_ F555W
versus m_ F555W-m_ F814W CMD had low photometric accuracy,
because it was obtained from the GO~9891 images alone. Therefore,
they were unable to distinguish between the intrinsic spread in color
and the broadening expected by photometric uncertainties. M08
obtained a CMD for this cluster from data with higher S/N (using both
GO~10595 and GO~9891 images) and demonstrated that NGC~1783 shows a
much larger spread in color than what would be expected by photometric
errors alone.

Our CMD of NGC~1783 is shown in Fig.~ and clearly
confirms the anomalous spread around the MSTO. In addition, the Hess
diagram in the inset reveals a splitted MSTO and strongly suggests
that the apparent spread could be attributed to the presence of two
distinct branches which are closely spaced and poorly resolved by the
observations.

Possible evidence of prolonged star formation





















The CMDs around the MSTO loci for the remaining twelve
intermediate-age clusters that have been studied in this work are
presented in Fig.~ - .

Unfortunately, being this an archive project, the photometric data-set
available for these twelve clusters is not homogeneous. One short and
two deep images for each of the three filters: F435W, F555W, and
F814W, were collected within program GO~10595; while one single deep
image in both F555W and F814W bands were collected within the
snap-shot program GO~9891. Only two clusters were observed by both
programs (NGC~1987 and NGC~2108), one cluster (ESO057-SC075) in
GO-10595 only, and the remaining nine (HODGE~7, IC~2146, NGC~1644,
NGC~1652, NGC~1795, NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1978 and NGC~2154) were
observed within GO~9891 only (see Tab.~1 for more details).

We find that seven of these clusters show hints of an intrinsic spread
around the MSTO: ESO057-SC075, HODGE~7, NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1987,
NGC~2108 and NGC~2154. The CMDs of IC~2146, NGC~1644, NGC~1652,
NGC~1795 and NGC~1978 show no evidence for such a spread and are all
consistent with hosting stars with the same age and chemical
composition, within our photometric precisions.

When simulated CMDs will be introduced, we will give a more objective
criterion to discriminate clusters with an intrinsic spread around the
MSTO (at the end of Section 6.2.2).

It must be noted that, apart from the broadened MSTO region, the other
primary features of the CMDs of these clusters (MS, RGB and AGB) are
narrow, and the HB red-clump is well-defined, thus the spread cannot
be an artifact produced by differential reddening or variations of
photometric zero points along the ACS field.

The limited statistic and photometric resolution do not allow us to
establish wheter, these spreads are just unresolved splits --as those
identified in the more populous clusters described in Sect.~4-- or not.

In the following section, we show that the spread around the MSTO of
the clusters mentioned above must be intrinsic. To do this, we will
demonstrate that the broadening we see cannot be explained by any
combination of photometric errors, field-star contamination, or
unresolved photometric binaries.





Does the spreaded MSTO reflect the presence of multiple stellar populations?

Globular-cluster systems with multiple populations manifest themselves
in many different photometric ways. In Cen we (Anderson
1997, Bedin et al.\ 2004) have detected a split of the MS, which can
only be explained by two stellar groups with different He content and
metallicity (Piotto et al.\ 2005), and also at least four distinct
SGBs (which may indicate age differences larger than 1 Gyr, see
Villanova et al.\ 2007 and references within). In NGC~2808 we
inferred the existence of three distinct stellar populations from the
presence of three MSs (which is most easily explained by three groups
of stars with different helium content, see Piotto et al.\ 2007). In
the case of NGC~1851, the presence of two populations of stars is
inferred from the fact that the SGB splits into two branches. This
feature can be explained either by two distinct bursts of star
formation with a time separation of about 1 Gyr, or by two stellar
populations with distinct initial chemical composition and a much
smaller age difference (Milone et al.\ 2008, Cassisi et al.\ 2008). A
splits of the SGB have also been observed in NGC~6388 (Piotto 2008)
demonstrating that this massive GC hosts two distinct stellar groups.
In a spectro-photometric study of M4, Marino et al.\ (2008) detected a
bimodal RGB, and demostrated that it is due to a bimodal distribution
of CN, Na, O, indicating that also this relatively-small cluster
contains multiple populations.

The Galactic clusters cited above variously exhibit broadening or
bifurcation of the RGB, SGB, and lower MS populations. In the case of
the intermediate-age LMC clusters we have studied here, we have
detected both splits of the MSTO, as in NGC~1846 and NGC~1806
(Sec.~, M07 and M08), in NGC~1751 and possibly NGC~1783
(Sec.~), and a broadening of the MSTO as the clusters
in Figs.~ -~ and NGC~2173 (Bertelli et al
\ 2003). The low numbers of stars on the RGB make it difficult to
assess the presence of a split or anomalous broadening along this
evolutionary sequence, and the distance of the LMC makes it impossible
to detect splits in the lower MS population with the presently
available data.

While the splits and broadening we have shown above look quite
convincing, it is important to consider the possibility that
photometric errors or other effects can generate anomalous spreads and
bifurcations, which could be confused with differences in age and/or
chemical composition. In addition, it is also important to consider
that both binaries and field stars contaminate the CMD region around
the MSTO where we are most sensitive to the presence of multiple
stellar populations.

In Section~, we demonstrate that the MSTO
broadening visible in Figs.~-~ is not due to
field-star contamination by statistically subtracting field stars from
the cluster CMD.

In Sec.~, we consider the influence that binary stars
could have on the spread of the MSTO. To do this, we will use
artificial stars to simulate the CMD of a single population plus a
population of binaries such that visible in the lower main sequence.
We then present the decontaminated cluster CMD and compare it with the
simulated one that includes both realistic errors and binaries to show
that the observed MSTO broadening cannot be explained by a single
population.

A method to decontaminate the cluster CMD from field stars

We began our analysis looking at the original CMD from stars near the
cluster center, where we estimated that the contamination by field
stars is at most at the level of 20\
Section~).

However, it is possible to reduce this contamination even further by
doing a statistical subtraction of the stars that are most likely to
be field stars. We have used the following approach which is based on
the assumption that the distribution of field stars in the CMD of the
cluster and reference field is nearly the same. For each star in the
reference field CMD, we calculated the distance to all the cluster
field stars: d= ( (m_ F435W-m_ F814W))^2+(
m_ F435W)^2 (or d= ( (m_ F555W-m_
F814W))^2+( m_ F555W)^2), and flagged the closest
cluster field star as a candidate to be subtracted.
We remind to the reader that
cluster and reference fields cover the same area.

We determined the ratio r between the completeness of this stars and
the completeness of the reference field star. Note that this ratio is
always r<1.0. In order to avoid to over-subtract field stars, we
generated a random number between 0 and 1, and removed the star from
the cluster CMD if this random number was less than the ratio of
the completenesses.



The main steps of this procedure are illustrated in Fig.~ for
NGC~1806: The upper panels show the CMD of stars in the reference
(left) and cluster (right) field, the bottom ones the CMD of
subtracted stars (left) and the decontaminated CMD (right). The
statistical subtraction of field stars has not been applied to the
most populated clusters (NGC~1978, NGC~1783), which occupy most of the
field of view and have the highest ratio of cluster to reference field
stars. We note that there is an additional young stellar cluster
within the ACS images of NGC~1852, so we were careful to select a
reference field that was as far as possible from both clusters.



Obviously, small variations in the distribution of stars in the
reference field are expected even within the small WFC/ACS field of
view. In order to check whether the reference field star distribution
can be reasonably assumed uniform we defined four regions with the
same area of the cluster field and the largest possible distance from
the cluster center. We extracted the CMD of each region and compared
it with that of the cluster field. A typical example of this procedure
is shown in Fig.~ for NGC~1987. In particular, we have
compared the number of stars (corrected for completeness) in the boxed
region around the MSTO. We found that, in most cases the variation of
the number of stars in this region is smaller than about 30\
Obviously, this procedure has been applied only to clusters that cover
a sufficiently small fraction of the ACS field of view. We cannot
exclude that the variation of the number of stars in reference field
regions could be (partially) due to contamination of cluster
members. However, we note that oversubtracting the cluster members
does not affect our results on the morphology of the MSTO.

The synthetic CMD

The main goal of this section is to generate a synthetic CMD of a
cluster with the same characteristics of the observed one, but hosting
a single stellar population. This is a necessary step to demonstrate
whether the observed spread in color around the MSTO is an intrinsic
feature due to the presence of multiple stellar populations or an
artifact produced by unresolved binaries or photometric errors.

In order to simulate a CMD that reproduces well enough the main
properties of the observed one we must ensure that:
itemize
the mass function of the synthetic CMD is as similar as possible
to the observed one;
simulated and observed stars have the same radial distribution,
completeness, and photometric errors;
the fraction and the mass ratio distribution of simulated
photometric binaries are as close as possible to the real ones.
itemize
In the following we describe the procedure that we have used to
generate a synthetic CMD with these requirements. It consists of two
main steps: in the first one we generate single stars; in the second
one we measure the fraction of photometric binaries in the observed
CMD and add to the simulated CMD the corresponding number of binary
systems.

Step one: simulation of single stars

We have separately simulated MS and evolved stars.

Unevolved Stars:

To generate single MS stars we started by selecting a sub-sample of
artificial stars with the following criterion. For each star in the
cluster field that survive to the statistical subtraction of reference
field stars of Section~, we have assigned a
sub-sample of the artificial stars and randomly extracted a star from
it (see Sect.~ for a description on how AS were
generated). The artificial-star sub-sample consists of all the
artificial stars with similar magnitudes (within 0.1 m_ F814W
mag) and radial distances (less then 50 pixel from the observed
star). This method produces a catalog of simulated stars with almost
the same luminosity, and radial distribution of the observed catalog.
This procedure has been applied only to MS stars.

Evolved Stars:

Things become more complicated for stars brighter than the MSTO where
the complex shape of the CMD makes it harder to associate a star with
the CMD sequence that corresponds to its evolutionary phase. For this
reason, a different approach was used to simulate evolved stars
(i.e. stars brighter than the MSTO).

First of all, we counted the number of MS stars (corrected for
completeness) with m_ F814W^ TO<m_ F814W<m_
F814W^ TO+0.5 and calculated the average number of stars per
unit mass N_M in this range of luminosity. Next, we obtained
N_M for stars brighter than the MSTO by using a Salpeter (1955)
IMF and associated these stars to each portion of the CMD according to
the Pietrinferni et al.\ (2004) models.

Since evolved stars should all have nearly the same mass, we would
expect that they would also have the same radial distribution. For
this reason, we randomly associated to each simulated evolved star the
radial distance of an observed star brighter than the MSTO. Finally,
for each simulated star, we selected the sample of artificial stars
with almost the same magnitude, color and distance from the cluster
center (we imposed that both input m_ F814W magnitude and color
must differ by less than 0.01 mag and radial distance by less than 50
pixels) and randomly extracted a star from it.

It must be noted that the simulated CMDs have photometric errors that
are slightly smaller than the errors of real stars. This reflects a
fundamental limitation of artificial-star tests: an artificial star is
measured by using the same PSF that was used to generate it, while for
the real stars we necessarely have an imperfect PSF. The PSF is
constructed to fit the real stars as well as possible, but there will
invariably be errors in the PSF model for the real stars, which will
not be present for the artificial stars. [However, it must be clearly
stated that these differences are appreciable only for the stars
with the highest S/N ratio].

Below, we describe the method that we used to estimate the difference
between the photometric errors of real and artificial stars. This
allows us to introduce an additional error component to the
artificial-star photometry so that the real and artificial sequences
can be directly compared. We illustrate the procedure for the case of
NGC~1806. The same procedure was applied for all clusters.

To determine how much artificial broadening of the error distribution
is necessary, we compare the color distribution of the observed and
simulated MS stars. Figure~ shows the color
distribution of MS stars for NGC~1806: the left panel contains the CMD
of all the stars contained in the cluster field after the subtraction
of the reference field stars. The red fiducial line (MSRL) is
computed by using the following procedure. We started by dividing the
CMD into bins of magnitude in the F814W band and, for each bin, we
calculated the median color and magnitude and obtained a raw fiducial
line by fitting these points with a spline. Then we derived for each
star the absolute value of the difference between its color and the
color of the fiducial line, and calculated the as the
68.27^ th percentile. All the stars with distances larger than
N~ from the fiducial were rejected and the survivors used to
redetermine the median color, magnitude and . We iterated this
procedure five times with N going from 6 to 2 (integer numbers).

In the middle panel we show the straightened CMD obtained by
subtracting from the color of each star the color of the fiducial
line. In the right panel we show the histograms of the color
distribution in eight m_ F814W magnitude intervals. The
distribution in color is well reproduced by a Gaussian plus a tail on
the red side due to the conspicuous number of photometric binaries and
blends.







In Fig.~ we also reproduce the distribution in color for
the artificial star MS. As expected, the spread of the latter is
slightly lower than that of the observed MS. We note that the
presence of this additional dispersion, does not allow us to exclude
intrinsic dispersion of the MSs smaller than ~0.03 mag in color, which
might result from dispersion of Z, Y, or a combination of the two (see
discussion in Milone et al.\ 2008). In Fig.~ we compare
the dispersions of the observed MS ( _ OBS, circles) and
for artificial stars ( _ ART, triangles) as a function of
the m_ F814W magnitude; the continuous lines are the best
fitting fourth order polynomials (P_ OBS and P_ ART).
Finally, we added to the color of each star of the artificial-star CMD
an error randomly extracted from a Gaussian distribution with
dispersion P_ DIF= P_ OBS^2-P_ ART^2.

Step two: simulation of binary systems

It is clear from the excess of stars on the red side of the main
sequence that many of these clusters have a sizeable binary
populations (compare Fig.~26 with Fig.~27). We expect that this binary population can have some
effect on the distribution of stars around the turnoff, so we will
estimate the binary-contamination effect. Binary stars of LMC
clusters will be unresolved even with HST, but the light from each
star will combine and the binary system will appear as a single
point-source object. These binaries can be discerned photometrically
from the single stars along the MS as they are located brightward and
to the red of the sequence. The position of the binary systems formed
by two MS stars (MS-MS binaries) with a different mass ratios in a
typical CMD of an intermediate age LMC clusters are illustrated in
Fig.~.



In the same region of the CMD, in addition to the true physically
associated binaries, we expect also a few chance superpositions
(blends). The artificial-star tests (see Fig.~27) show that this is a
very small effect.

It is important to note here that measuring the fraction of binaries
is not the goal of this paper; our aim here is to estimate their
fraction so that we can determine how much of the spread of the MSTO
region can reasonably be attributed to them.

Binaries can be parametrized by their mass ratio, q = m_1/m_2,
where m_1<m_2. In order to estimate the fraction of MS-MS
photometric binaries with mass ratio greater than a threshold value
(hereafter q_ th, see Tab.~2 for the adopted q_ th for
each cluster) we have applied the methods described in Milone et
al.\ (2008) and Bedin et al.\ (2008). We divided the CMD into two
regions: the first one (A) contains all the single MS stars and
binaries with a primary star with (m_ F814W^
MSTO+0.4)<m_ (F814W)<(m_ F814W^ MSTO+2.4) (where
m_ F814W^ MSTO is the magnitude of the MSTO in the F814W
band). It corresponds to the light and dark grey area of
Fig.~. The second region (B) is the part of A
that contains MS-MS binaries with q>q_ th, and corresponds to
the dark grey area of Fig.~. We adopted q_
th=0.6 or q_ th=0.7, as indicated in Tab.~2, depending on
the photometric quality of the data. The fraction of binaries with
q>q_ th has been evaluated as:

center

f_ BIN^q>q_ th= N_ CLUSTER^ B - N_ REFERENCE^ B
N_ CLUSTER^ A - N_ REFERENCE^ A
- N_ ARTS^ B N_ ARTS^ A

center



Where N_ CLUSTER^ A(B) is the number of stars (corrected
for completeness) observed in the region A (B) of the CMD extracted
from the cluster field. N_ REFERENCE^ A(B) are the
corresponding numbers of stars in the CMD of the reference field and
account for the field contamination. N_ ARTS^ A(B) refer
to artificial stars: their ratio indicates the fraction of blends.
Finally, we calculated the global fraction of binaries by
interpolation, assuming a flat mass-ratio distribution. The only
differences from what done in Milone et al.\ (2008) and Bedin et
al.\ (2008) is that in this paper we have removed the contribution
from field stars by using the CMD observed in the reference region,
rather than by using a Galactic model or proper motions. The measured
fraction of binaries in each cluster are in Tab.~2.

We tried very hard to get a reliable binary fraction for those
clusters, but unfortunately, their are just too big on ACS/WFC FOV.
If we take the outskirts as representative of the field we would
end up subtracting cluster members from clusters, and since energy
equipartion make the binary to sink into the cluster core, this
could potentially generate dangerous biases in the relative
fraction of single to binary system. We avoid on purpose to give
numbers in Table 1 for those clusters, to avoid contamination of
the literature with unreliable values of the binary-fraction for
those objects.

To simulate binary stars to be added to the simulated CMD described in
Sec.~ we adopted the following procedure:
itemize
We selected a fraction F_ BIN
of single stars equal to the measured
fraction of binaries and derived their masses by using the
Pietrinferni et al. (2004) mass-luminosity relation (for the
clusters where the measure of the binary fraction is not available
we assumed the average value of F_ BIN=0.33);

For each of them, we calculated the mass M_2=q M_1 of the
secondary star and obtained the corresponding m_ F814W
magnitude. Its color was derived by the MSRL;

Finally, we summed up the F435W (or F555W) and F814W fluxes of the two
components, calculated the corresponding magnitudes, added the
corresponding photometric error, and replaced in the CMD the original
star with this binary system.
itemize
Figures~, ~, ~ and ~ show
the contribution that we would expect from binaries to the broadening
of the cluster TOs. It is clear that the double MSTO in NGC~1806,
NGC~1846, and NGC~1751, and the extended (broadened) MSTO in
ESO057-SC075, HODGE~7, NGC~1783, NGC~1852, NGC~1917, NGC~1987,
NGC~2108 and NGC~2154 are intrinsic features of these objects, and
cannot due to field-star contamination, photometric errors or
binaries. In these figures, we show, from the left to the right, a
zoom of the original cluster-field CMD around the MSTO, the same
portion of the CMD but for stars in the reference field, the CMD after
field-star decontamination, and the simulated CMD for these clusters.

Figure~35 and 36 illustrate the same exercise for the clusters with no
significant MSTO broadening.

Now that we have introduced the simulated CMDs we can describe how we
discriminate between clusters that show evidence of hosting a multiple
population, and those which do not. First, we calculated the
dispersion of stars along a same direction perpendicular to the
obseverd spread (on the right of the MSTO) for real
( _SGB^OBS) and artificial stars ( _SGB^ART).
Then, we considered a cluster as hosting a multiple population if the
dispersion of real stars was more than three times the dispersion of
the simulated CMD. This condition is verified for eleven out the
sixteen clusters. Although the exact position of the line along which
to measure the spread is not unique, it seemed to us a reasonably
solid approach.

Isochrones fitting

M07 and M08 proposed that the split of the MSTO of NGC~1846 and
NGC~1806 is consistent with the presence of two distinct stellar
populations with the same chemical composition and a difference in age
of about 300 Myr. In addition, M08 have suggested that the
spread of the MSTO of NGC~1783 can be attributed to a prolonged star
formation.

In the previous sections, we have demonstrated that eight additional
clusters show strong indications of an intrinsic spread or split of
the CMD around the MSTO region. The remaining five objects of our
sample show no significant evidence for multiple stellar population
within our photometric precision (see Fig.~ and
~).

We note that in the clusters where a spread in the MSTO is claimed,
the other evolutionary sequences are narrow and well defined, after a
correction for differential reddening has been made. The tightness of
these other sequences is also a strong indication that there is very
little variation in metallicity among the stars.

Therefore, in the absence of any detailed chemical composition
analysis, in what follows we will assume that any spread around the
MSTO can be attributed to a difference in age alone. We will derive
the main parameters for each cluster (metallicity, age, and the
maximum age spread among the populations) by fitting the data with the
isochrones from the BaSTI evolutionary code (Pietrinferni et al.\
2004, updated version of August 2008). Each of the isochrones has a
solar-scaled distribution of metals and includes convective
overshooting.

To determine the isochrone that best matches the observed CMD of our
clusters with no evidence of an intrinsic spread around the MSTO we
followed a procedure similar to the one adopted by M07. We generated
a grid of isochrones using metallicities of Z= 0.008 and 0.010,
sampling an age range between 1.0 and 3.0 Gyrs at intervals of 0.05
Gyr. Then, we defined by hand:\ the magnitude of the MSTO, the color
of the RGB at a level intermediate between that of the red end of the
SGB and that of the HB red-clump, and the magnitude of the HB
red-clump. In this way we calculated the difference in magnitude
between the MSTO and the HB red-clump ( _ mag) and the
difference in color between the MSTO and the fiducial points on the
RGB ( _ col). Then we calculated a value of _
mag and _ col for each isochrone in the grid and
compared them with the observed ones. Finally, we selected all the
isochrones where _ col and _ mag differ
respectively by less 0.25 and 0.03 magnitudes and fitted
them to the CMD by hand. To do this, we varied the distance modulus
in the range 18.30<(m-M)_0<18.70 and the reddening between 0.00
and 0.30, both in steps of 0.01 mag and searched for the combination
that best matches the cluster sequences.
For clusters with a double or broadened MSTO, we used a similar
approach with the exception that, in this case, we first defined on
the observed CMD the magnitude of the MSTO and the values of
_ mag and _ col for the bMSTO and
determined the isochrone that best fits this younger population.
Then, we selected all the isochrones with the same metallicity,
distance modulus and reddening, but different ages and fitted the
fMSTO (for clusters with a broadened MSTO we calculated those values
that correspond to the brighter and the fainter region of the MSTO).

The best fitting distance modulus, reddening, metallicity and age are
listed in Tab.~3. The last column indicates the maximum age
difference, _ age, for stars in clusters that show
possible evidence of multiple or prolonged star formation episodes.

In Fig.~, Fig.~ and Fig.~, we have
overplotted to the observed CMDs the best fitting isochrones.
Interestingly, the multiple (or prolonged) star-formation episodes
seem to lay between 150 and 250 Myr, very similar to the time interval
between successive star formation episodes in the intermediate mass
AGB star ejecta pollution depicted by Ventura et al (2001).

Conclusions

High precision HST ACS/HST photometry of sixteen intermediate age LMC
stellar clusters has revealed that eleven of them (i.e. about the 70 25\
of the entire sample) host multiple stellar populations.

The CMDs of NGC~1806, NGC~1846 and NGC~1751 exhibit two dinstinct
MSTOs, suggesting that these clusters have experienced (at least) two
main episodes of star formation with a temporal separation of 200 -
250 Myr. For these three clusters the high quality of our photometry
enabled us, not only to distinguish the two populations, but also to
measure the fraction of stars belonging to each of them. In all the
cases, the population corresponding to the brighter MSTO (the younger
population) is the main population, and includes more then two-third
of cluster stellar population, consistent with the intermediate mass
AGB pollution scenario (See D'Antona \& Caloi 2008 for a recent review).

Our photometry strongly suggests that the intrinsic broadening of the
MSTO of NGC~1783 observed by M08 could be attributed to the presence
of two distinct branches which are closely spaced and poorly resolved
by the observations.

In seven additional clusters, namely ESO057-SC075, HODGE7, NGC~1852,
NGC~1917, NGC~1987, NGC~2108, and NGC~2154 we observed a wide spread
in color for the stars around the MSTO. In spite of this, the other
main features of the CMD are narrow and well-defined, demonstrating
that the spread cannot be an artifact produced by differential
reddening, by variation of the photometric zero point along the chip,
or by a relatively large spread in metallicity. By using the CMD of the stars in the
fields that surround the cluster, we demonstrate that the observed
feature is unequivocally associated with the clusters. Finally,
artificial stars and simulated CMDs show that the wide spread in color
observed around the MSTO cannot be produced by photometric errors or
binaries. It is interesting to note that the age spreads observed in
this sample appear to be quite similar: they are all between 150 and
250 Myr.
