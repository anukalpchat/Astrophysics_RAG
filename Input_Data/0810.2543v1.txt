abstract
We present an X-ray study of the low-luminosity active galactic
nucleus (AGN) in NGC~4258 using data from Suzaku,
XMM-Newton, and the Swift/BAT survey. We find that signatures
of X-ray reprocessing by cold gas are very weak in the spectrum of
this Seyfert-2 galaxy; a weak, narrow fluorescent-K emission
line of cold iron is robustly detected in both the Suzaku and
XMM-Newton spectra but at a level much below that of most other
Seyfert-2 galaxies. We conclude that the circumnuclear environment of
this AGN is very ``clean'' and lacks the Compton-thick obscuring torus
of unified Seyfert schemes. From the narrowness of the iron line,
together with evidence for line flux variability between the
Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations, we constrain the line
emitting region to be between 3 10^3r_g and 4 10^4r_g
from the black hole. We show that the observed properties of the iron
line can be explained if the line originates from the surface layers
of a warped accretion disk. In particular, we present explicit
calculations of the expected iron line from a disk warped by
Lens-Thirring precession from a misaligned central black hole.
Finally, the Suzaku data reveal clear evidence for large
amplitude 2--10\,keV variability on timescales of 50\,ksec as well as
smaller amplitude flares on timescales as short as 5--10\,ksec. If
associated with accretion disk processes, such rapid variability
requires an origin in the innermost regions of the disk (r
10r_g or less). Analysis of the difference spectrum between a high-
and low-flux state suggests that the variable component of the X-ray
emission is steeper and more absorbed than the average AGN emission,
suggesting that the primary X-ray source and absorbing screen have
spatial structure on comparable scales. We note the remarkable
similarity between the circumnuclear environment of NGC~4258 and
another well-studied low-luminosity AGN, M81*.

black hole physics, galaxies: Seyfert, galaxies: individual
(NGC~4258), X-ray: galaxies

Introduction

The low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) \ is an
essential object in our quest to understand the astrophysics of
extragalactic supermassive black holes. Very Large Array (VLA) and
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations have found a set
of water masers that trace a nearly edge-on, geometrically-thin gas
disk 0.2-0.3 from the central black hole (Miyoshi et
al. 1995; Herrnstein et al. 1999). The near-perfect Keplerian
velocity curve of these water masers provides one of the strongest and
most robust pieces of evidence for the existence of extragalactic
supermassive black holes (Miyoshi et al. 1995). Furthermore, the
dynamics of this disk allows precise measurements of the central black
hole mass, (outer) accretion disk inclination and warping, and
its distance (M = 3.9 0.3 10^7\, , D = 7.2
0.5\,Mpc, yielding r_g GM/c^2 = 5.8 10^12\, cm,
1\,pc =5.4 10^5~r_g, and 1'' = 35\,pc; Miyoshi et al. 1995;
Herrnstein et al. 1999). This is the only AGN for which the black hole
mass, distance, and (outer) accretion disk geometry are so accurately
known.

Due to the precision with which the black hole mass and distance are
known, \ can be used as a basic test-bed for our models of black
hole accretion. The overall luminosity of the AGN is small compared
with the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, L
10^-4\,L_ Edd, the cause of which has remained
controversial. Is the small luminosity simply due to a very small mass
accretion rate through a radiatively-efficient disk, as suggested by
modeling the physics of the maser production Neufeld \& Maloney
(1995)? Or does the disk make a transition to a
radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) at some radius as
suggested by the modeling of Lasota et al. (1996) and Gammie, Narayan
\& Blandford (1999)? What is the role of the jet, and how much of the
radiative luminosity of the AGN is actually due to the jet (Yuan et
al. 2002). In the bigger picture, what is the fundamental difference
among the accretion flows in the most underluminous galactic nuclei
(e.g., ), LLAGN and powerful AGN?

Sensitive X-ray observations provide a powerful means of probing both
large scale and small scale structures within NGC~4258 and hence
addressing these questions. Soft X-ray thermal emission from hot gas
associated with the well known helically twisted jets (the anomalous
arms) has been known since the Einstein days (Fabbiano et
al. 1992; also see ROSAT work of Pietsch et al. 1994; Cecil,
Wilson \& De Pree 1995; Vogler \& Pietsch 1999). However, power-law
X-ray emission from the (absorbed) central engine of the AGN itself
was not seen until the advent of ASCA (Makishima et al. 1994;
Reynolds, Nowak \& Maloney 2000). ASCA clearly revealed
variability of both the absorbing column and hard X-ray flux on the
timescale of years (Reynolds et al. 2000; hereafter R00), a result
supported by short observations of NGC~4258 by XMM-Newton and
Chandra (Pietsch \& Read 2002; Young et al. 2004; Fruscione et
al. 2005). The most sensitive hard X-ray (>10 ) study of
NGC~4258 was conducted by \ (200\,ksec; Fiore et al. 2001) which
detected the AGN emission out to beyond 50\,keV (Fiore et al. 2001).
\ also revealed day-timescale variability of the hard X-ray
power-law, setting a firm upper limit of 250\,r_g (5
10^-4\,pc) to the X-ray emission region size.

In this Paper, we present results from new Suzaku and
XMM-Newton observations of NGC~4258 which, when supplemented with
survey data from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), gives us
an unprecedented view of this AGN from 0.3\,keV upto 140\,keV. These
data suggest a circumnuclear environment that is remarkably ``clean''
compared with other Seyfert 2 nuclei. Suzaku also reveals rapid
variability of the AGN emission, allowing us to set new constraints on
the size/compactness of the X-ray source. The plan of this paper is
as follows. Section~2 briefly discusses the data that we utilize and
the basic reduction steps. We present our analysis of the spectrum,
as well as spectral variability, in Section~3. Section~4 discusses
the implications of these results for our understanding of the
structure of this AGN and the origin of the X-ray emission. In
particular, we argue that the iron line has all of the properties
expected if it were to originate from the surface layers of the
(warped) accretion disk. Throughout this paper we quote error bars at
the 90\
bars on figures are displayed at the 1 level.

Observations and data reduction

In this section, we discuss the new observations presented in this
paper and the subsequent data reduction.

Suzaku observed NGC~4258 for a total of 186\,ksec starting
10-Jun-2006 as part of the Cycle-1 Guest Observer Program (PI: Itoh,
US Co-PI: Reynolds). All four X-ray Imaging Spectrometers (XIS~0--3)
as well as the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) were operational and
collecting data, and NGC~4258 was placed at the ``nominal HXD''
aimpoint. Reduction started from the cleaned Version-2 data products,
and data were further reduced using FTOOLS version 6.4 according to
the standard procedure outlined in the ``Suzaku Data Reduction (ABC)
Guide''. The standard filtering resulted in 88.5\,ksec of ``good''
XIS data. Spectra and lightcurves were extracted from all XISs using
a circular region of radius 3.25\,arcmin centered on NGC~4258.
Background spectra were obtained from rectangular source free regions
(avoiding the calibration sources) around the chip edges. Response
matrices and effective area curves were generated using the
xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tools, respectively, using the
recommended 400,000 photons per energy bin during the construction of
the effective area files. We also utilize HXD data in this paper.
Standard filtering resulted in 97.5\,ksec of ``good''
Suzaku-HXD/PIN data from which a spectrum was constructed. A PIN
background spectrum was produced that included the Cosmic X-ray
Background (CXB) plus the latest model of the detector background. We
do not consider HXD/GSO data in this paper due to the fact that the
high background of this detector makes a detection of NGC~4258
impossible.

The XMM-Newton data presented in this paper result from a
continuous 65\,ksec exposure started on 17-Nov-2006, 160 days after
the Suzaku observation. All of the European Photon Imaging
Cameras (EPIC) were operated in PrimeFullWindow mode, and the
data were cleaned using the Science Analysis System (SAS) version 7.1
following the standard procedure outlined in the ``User's Guide to
XMM-Newton SAS''. We reject data during three background flares (PN
count rate >50\,ct\,s^-1). The final ``good'' exposure time for
the EPIC detectors is 55\,ksec. EPIC spectra were extracted using a
circular extraction region of radius 30\,arcsec centered on the bright
nucleus of NGC~4258, and background spectra were extracted using a
nearby source free circular region of radius 1.5\,arcmin.

The Swift/BAT is a wide field (2 steradians) coded aperture hard
X-ray instrument which, during normal operations, surveys 60\
sky each day at <20\,milliCrab sensitivity. The BAT spectrum used
here was prepared as part of the 22-month extension to the BAT-survey.
The BAT survey spectra are derived from an independent all sky mosaic
map in each of nine energy bins averaged over 22 months of data
beginning on Dec 5 2004. The energy bin edges are 14, 20, 24, 35, 50,
75, 100, 150, 195 keV. The nature of the coded-mask analysis
naturally results in a background-subtracted source spectrum. As
discussed in Tueller et al. (2008), fitting of the BAT data was
performed using a diagonal response matrix which correctly accounts
for instrumental systematics in sources with spectral indices similar
to the Crab (photon index 2). See Tueller et al. (2008)
for more details.

All spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin to
facilitate ^2 fitting. All spectral analysis presented here is
performed using XSPECv11.3.2.

Results

In this section, we describe the spectral and temporal properties of
the X-ray emission from NGC~4258. Given its superior signal-to-noise
and energy band our discussion focuses on the Suzaku dataset,
although we compare and contrast with the new XMM-Newton dataset
where ever appropriate. In order to extend the energy reach of our
time-averaged spectral study ( ), we supplement
the Suzaku data with Swift/BAT data. Finally, in order to
study long-term variations in the all-important fluorescent iron line,
we include data from our new XMM-Newton observation as well as
archival XMM-Newton and ASCA data.

The 0.3--140\,keV spectrum

The combination of the Suzaku/XISs, the Suzaku/PIN and the
Swift/BAT allows us to form the spectrum of \ over the
energy range 0.3--140\,keV (see Fig.~ which, for
clarity, only shows one of the four XISs). This spectrum extends to
significantly higher energy than any previous study of . It must
be cautioned, however, that the Swift/BAT data are collected
over a 22-month period compared with the Suzaku ``snapshot''.
In this study, we make the assumption that the form/shape of the
high-energy (>10 ) spectrum does not change with time even if its
normalization does change. This allows us to perform joint spectral
fits of the Suzaku and Swift/BAT data in order to study
the nature of the X-ray source and the circumnuclear environment.

Guided by previous studies of this source, we model this spectrum as
the superposition of optically-thin thermal plasma emission with
temperature T (described by the XSPEC model vmekal; Mewe et
al. 1985; Kaastra 1992; Liedahl et al. 1995), an absorbed power-law
(with photon index absorbed by a cold column N_ H),
and an additional continuum component required to correctly describe
the inflection point in the spectrum around 2\,keV where thermal
plasma emission and absorbed power-law swap dominance. There are
several possible identifications of this additional continuum
component including (1) AGN emission that has scattered around the
absorbing matter, (2) AGN emission that has leaked through a patchy
absorber, (3) hard X-ray emission associated with X-ray binaries in
the galaxy, or (4) thermal emission from very hot gas associated with
star formation or the interaction of the AGN jet with the galactic
disk. Both the intrinsic absorption and the Galactic absorption (from
a column N_ H=1.45 10^20\, cm^-2; Dickey \&
Lockman 1990) were described using the phabs model. To obtain a
good description of the soft X-ray data, we require that the elemental
abundances are allowed to vary relative to solar values (as defined by
Anders \& Grevesse 1989) in two groups, Group A (with abundance Z_A)
consisting of \C,N,O,Ne,Na,Mg,Al,Si,S,Ar,Ca\, and group B (with
abundance Z_B) containing \Fe,Ni\.

In our Canonical Spectral Model, the additional continuum component is
modeled by a power-law component with photon index equal to that of
the main (absorbed) AGN powerlaw ( _2= ) that is
unaffected by the intrinsic absorption. This is an appropriate
spectral model to describe the scattering or leaky absorber scenario.
This model provides a decent description of the spectrum ( ^2/
dof=4506/4003) with best-fitting parameters
=1.75^+0.05_-0.04, N_ H=(9.2^+0.4_-0.3)
10^22\, cm^-2, kT=0.54 0.01 ,
Z_A=0.49^+0.10_-0.08Z_ , Z_B=0.27^+0.05_-0.04Z_ .
The normalization of the additional continuum component relative to
the main AGN powerlaw is f=6.0 0.4\
the scattering or leakage fraction. If we allow the photon index of
the additional continuum component to be free, the fit does not
improve and we find that _2 is very poorly constrained. Using
this spectral model, we deduce an observed 0.5--10\,keV flux F^
obs_0.5-10=9.7 10^-12 and observed 0.5--10\,keV
luminosity L^ obs_0.5-10=6.0 10^40 . Removing
the effects of absorption within the model implies an intrinsic
0.5--10\,keV luminosity of L^X_0.5-10=1.4 10^41 .
The best-fitting normalization of the BAT model is 48\
Suzaku model. We interpret this as true variability, i.e., the
Suzaku observation caught the source at a time when the
high-energy emission has twice the normalization of the 22-month
average spectrum.

The second continuum component can also be described by an additional
thermal plasma component; however, while a good fit can be obtained
( ^2/ dof=4501/4004), a rather hot (kT>5.5 ) and
low-metallicity (Z<0.26Z_ ) plasma is required. Thus, since it
is not clear from where such a plasma component would originate, we
prefer the power-law description of this additional continuum
component.

Our Canonical Spectral Model fit leaves a line-like residue in the
0.5--0.6\,keV range that likely signals soft X-ray complexity beyond
the simple one-temperature thermal plasma model. Adding a second
plasma component with an identical abundance pattern but different
temperature (kT=0.22 0.02 ) leads to a significant improvement
in the goodness of fit ( ^2/ dof=4360/4001). However, a
robust exploration of these multi-temperature solutions is not
possible at XIS-resolutions (e.g., the abundances are poorly
constrained) and we defer further discussion of this to a future
publications in which high resolution spectral data from the
XMM-Newton/RGS and a long Chandra/HETG observation) will be
discussed.

The combination of the XIS, PIN and BAT data allows us to examine the
hard X-ray spectrum of this source in more detail than previously
possible. For the hard-band study of this paragraph, the data below
3\,keV were formally excluded from the analysis to prevent their
high-statistical weight from biasing the high-energy fit. No
significant deviations from a pure absorbed power-law are detected
above 3\,keV. Of course, in order for the observed powerlaw (with
<2) not to possess a divergent energy, it must cut-off or roll
over at some high energy. If the power-law has an exponential cutoff,
the characteristic e-folding energy is constrained by our high-energy
data to be E_ fold>124 . If we instead assume a pure-power
law with cold X-ray reflection (modeled using the pexrav code;
Magdziarz \& Zdziarski 1995), the constraints on the ``reflection
fraction'' R are very dependent upon the assumed inclination
of the reflector. If the reflector has a slab geometry with a very
high inclination (i>80^ ), as expected if we identify it with
the inner accretion disk, then these data provide no meaningful
constraints on the reflection fraction. For more face-on reflection
(e.g., the surfaces of discrete cold clouds or the inner wall of a
cold torus on the far side of the X-ray source), we find
R<0.43. If we allow both reflection and an exponential cutoff
simultaneously, the limits on the e-folding energy become weaker
(E_ fold>67 ) but constraints on reflection are essentially
unaffected. The implications of this result for the circumnuclear
environment in this Seyfert nucleus is discussed in 4.

An identical analysis of the 0.7--10\,keV XMM-Newton/EPIC (PN
and MOS) data (supplemented with the Swift/BAT spectrum) gives a
similar picture, although there are some quantitative differences.
Firstly, the flux of the thermal plasma emission is lower by a factor
of two, a simple consequence of the fact that much of this emission
lies in the anomalous arms and is outside of the our EPIC extraction
region. The temperature and iron abundance of this emission
(kT=0.58 0.01 , Z_B=0.17^+0.08_-0.05Z_ ) are very
similar to that derived from Suzaku, although the light metal
abundance is slightly lower (Z_A=0.20^+0.11_-0.06Z_ ). The
most robust differences are with the parameters describing the
absorbed power-law; the power-law is flatter ( =1.65 0.07)
and less absorbed [N_H=(7.7 0.5) 10^22 ] in the new
XMM-Newton data as compared with the earlier Suzaku
observation. Accompanying these changes is a decrease in intrinsic
(unabsorbed) 0.5--10\,keV luminosity from L^X_0.5-10=1.4
10^41 to L^X_0.5-10=6 10^40 . We will see
below that these long-term changes are in the same sense as short term
variability seen within the Suzaku observation and may be
revealing aspects of the spatial structure of the X-ray source and
absorber.

The Suzaku detection of a weak iron line

The width, strength, and variability of the 6.4\,keV K-shell
fluorescent line of cold iron is one of the most powerful probes of
cold gas in the circumnuclear environment of an X-ray luminous AGN.
The Suzaku spectrum of \ shows the most robust evidence to
date for this iron line in this source (Fig.~).
Adding a Gaussian line to the Canonical Spectral Model leads to a very
significant improvement in the goodness-of-fit ( ^2=-40 for
three additional model parameters) and gives a line energy, width,
flux and equivalent width of E=6.42 0.03 , <0.07
(corresponding to a full width half maximum, FWHM<1.1
10^4 ), F_ K =(6.0^+1.9_-1.6) 10^-6\,
ph\, cm^-2\, s^-1 and W_K =45 17 ,
respectively. Assuming Keplerian orbits in an edge-on accretion disk,
the limit on the FWHM corresponds to r>3 10^3\,r_g (6
10^-3 ).

We note that the equivalent width of the iron line is entirely
consistent with the limits on reflection reported in
Section~. If, for now, we assume that the iron
line is produced by isotropic illumination of a planar optically-thick
structure, we can use the relations reported in Matt, Fabian \&
Reynolds (1997) to infer that the solid angle of the reflector
as seen by the X-ray source satisfies

2 0.25 2 \, (1+1/ ),

where is the inclination of the slab, we have assumed Anders
\& Grevesse (1989) abundances. Note that the quantity /2
can be compared directly with the reflection fraction quoted in
Section~. A more sophisticated treatment of the
iron line strength expected via reflection from the surface of the
warped accretion disk in NGC~4258 (including all of the relevant
geometric effects) will be deferred to Section~4.1.

Once the narrow iron line component has been modeled, there is no
evidence in the XIS spectra for an additional broad/relativistic iron
line from the inner accretion disk. However, due to the high
inclination angle of the inner disk the limits are not strong.
Including a Schwarzschild disk-line (modeled using the fully
relativistic code of Brenneman \& Reynolds [2006]) with a rest-frame
energy of E=6.4 and an emissivity profile r^-3
between r_ in=6r_g and r_ out=1000r_g, we derive an
upper limit on the equivalent width of any broad iron line of W_
broad<180 assuming an inner disk inclination of i=80^ . By
contrast, even if the inner disk is in an optically-thick fluorescing
state and irradiated by an isotropic X-ray source, limb-darkening
effects would likely reduce the equivalent width of the broad iron
line to below 100\,eV (Matt et al. 1997; R00). Thus, we cannot yet
rule out the possibility of an optically-thick X-ray irradiated inner
accretion disk.

Despite the lower signal-to-noise, the iron line is also robustly
detected in the new XMM-Newton EPIC data. Adding a Gaussian
line leads to an improvement in the goodness-of-fit of
^2=-26 for three additional model parameters, and gives a
line energy, width, flux and equivalent width of E=6.41 0.03 ,
<0.07 , F_ K =(3.3^+1.2_-1.0)
10^-6\, ph\, cm^-2\, s^-1 and W_K =53
19 , respectively. Comparing the XMM-Newton and Suzaku
iron line fits, we see evidence for a decrease in the flux of the iron
line. Motivated by the desire to use line variability to locate the
fluorescing matter, this result prompts us to conduct a more
systematic analysis of the long term variability of the iron line.

Long term variability of the iron line flux

Given the weak nature of the iron line in NGC~4258 (which is itself a
comparatively X-ray faint AGN), there are relatively few datasets
capable of providing good constraints on the line flux. In addition
to the deep Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations presented
here, we examine five additional datasets from the HEASARC archives; a
deep ASCA observation (15--20 May 1999; 169\,ks of good data),
and four shorter XMM-Newton observations (8-Dec-2000 [21.6\,ks];
6-May-2001 [12.9\,ks]; 17-June-2001 [13.6\,ks]; 22-May-2001
[16.5\,ks]). We note that there is also a 15.2\,ks XMM-Newton
observation on 17-Dec-2001 that we choose to ignore due to it being
severely affected by flares in the instrumental background. The
XMM-Newton data were processed according to the description given in
2. Processing of the ASCA data follows R00 except for the use
of the latest version of the FTOOLS/HEADAS package (v6.4) and
calibration files.

Figure~ shows the iron line flux, equivalent
width, and the 6--7\,keV continuum flux for all of the data under
consideration. The superior statistics of the new datasets are
evident. The hypothesis of a constant line flux can be formally
rejected at the 95\
whereas the data are consistent with a constant equivalent width (a
model with W_ K =49 gives ^2=7.7 for 6 degrees of
freedom). The evidence for flux variability comes primarily from the
new XMM-Newton dataset (MJD~54056) which coincides with a
historical minimum in the 6-7\,keV continuum flux.

Variations of the line flux by almost a factor of two over the course
of 160 days (i.e., between the new Suzaku and XMM-Newton
observations) allows us to place interesting constraints on the
location of the fluorescing matter; the light crossing time of the
full line emitting region must be no greater than 160 days (and likely
significantly smaller). Thus, we conclude that the line emitting
material is within a radius of 0.07 (4 10^4r_g) from the
central X-ray source. This strongly suggests that there is cold
material (producing fluorescent iron emission) within the masing
portion of the disk (the masers appear to have an inner truncation
radius of approximately 0.13\,pc).

The Suzaku flare

Significant time variability on a range of characteristic timescales
is seen during the Suzaku observation
(Fig.~). A broad 100\,ksec hump is centered
within the (almost) 200\,ksec observation window. However, much more
rapid variability is apparent. Applying a Bayesian Blocks
analysis http://space.mit.edu/CXC/analysis/SITAR/bb\_experiment.html
(based upon earlier work by Scargle 1998), which searches for
flare-like structure in lightcurves dominated by Poisson statistics,
the overall lightcurve is found to be significantly variable; with
robust evidence for 10\
alarm probability p=3 10^-5), and good evidence for the
presence of a 5\,ksec flare (p=8.5 10^-2).

Direct inspection of XIS images confirm that the variable source is
located at the nucleus of NGC~4258 to within 20^ . This
confirms and strengthens the case for rapid variability seen by
BeppoSAX (Fiore et al. 2001), and alleviates the background and
confusion concerns expressed by Fruscione et al. (2005) about the
BeppoSAX variability. In the absence of relativistic beaming
effects, light-crossing time arguments allow one to estimate an
approximate upper limit to the size of the emitting regions; the large
amplitude 50\,ksec variability should originate from a region smaller
than about 250r_g, whereas the corresponding limit for the rapid
5\,ksec flare is just 25r_g. If this variability is associated with
accretion disk processes, more stringent limits can be set by equating
these timescales with the dynamical time of a Keplerian disk
^-1= r^3/GM. Thus, under this disk-origin scenario,
the 50\,ksec variability should originate from within r 40r_g
whereas the 5\,ksec flare should occur in the innermost disk,
r 10r_g.

We search for any spectral changes during the flare by splitting the
Suzaku observation into a ``low-state'' and a ``high-state''.
Only the XIS data have sufficient S/N to permit this exercise. We
define the threshold distinguishing high-state from low state to be a
total XIS count rate of 1\,cps. Using the Canonical Spectral Model,
the low-state XIS0--3 spectra are fit jointly with the high-state
XIS0--3 spectra. The parameters describing the soft thermal plasma
emission are fixed between the low- and high-state spectral models.
Initially, we also assume that the photon index of the AGN emission
and the intrinsic absorption column were also the same for the two
states, with only the normalizations of the AGN power-laws being
allowed to float between the low- and high-state spectral models. The
resulting best-fit parameters are identical to that found for the full
time-averaged spectrum. We then allow the photon index and the
absorbing column density to be different between the low- and
high-state. While there was a hint that both the photon index and the
absorbing column density increased in the high-state, the formal
improvement in the goodness of fit is not statistically
significant ( ^2=-5 for the additional of two new model
parameters). Thus, direct spectral modeling of the low- and
high-state spectra does not reveal robust evidence of spectral
variability.

An alternative methodology is to construct and then model the
high-low difference spectrum; this is a formally correct procedure
(and yields meaningful results) if the physical difference between the
high- and low-state is the addition of a new emission component. We
find that the difference spectrum has the form of a pure absorbed
power-law; this explicitly demonstrates that, as expected, the soft
X-ray thermal plasma component has not changed between the high- and
low-state spectra. Interestingly, both the absorption column and
photon index characterizing this variable emission differ from that
found in the time-averaged spectrum, N_
H=(1.58^+0.37_-0.31) 10^23\, cm^-2 and
=2.4 0.5 [compared with N_
H=(9.2^+0.4_-0.3) 10^22 and
=1.75^+0.05_-0.04 for the time-averaged spectrum.] While
these results must be taken as tentative, it appears that the
difference spectra are revealing spectral changes that are too subtle
to be revealed by direct modeling of the low- and high-state spectra
alone.

Discussion

The origin of the fluorescent iron line

Our study has found the first significant evidence of iron line flux
variability in this source. Combined with the limits on the velocity
width of the iron line, the variability allows us to constrain the
line emitting region to the range 3 10^3r_g<r<4 10^4r_g
(6 10^-3 <r<7 10^-2 ). The most obvious
candidate for the fluorescing matter on these spatial scales is the
accretion disk itself.

Assuming an isotropic X-ray source at the center of the accretion
disk, the expected iron line from the disk can be estimated once we
have a model for the 3-dimensional geometry of the warped disk
relative to the observer. Martin (2008; M08) has recently described
the maser data for NGC~4258 accretion disk using a model of a disk
warped by the General Relativistic frame-dragging effects of central
rotating black hole (Bardeen \& Petterson 1975). As described in the
Appendix, we have calculated the expected iron line equivalent width
and the radial distribution of iron line emission for both the overall
best fitting warped disk model of M08, and the best fitting warped
disk model of M08 that is stable to self-gravity. These two warped
disk models have a total warp angle between the inner and outer disk
of =45.8^ and 85.9^ , respectively. Assuming solar
abundances (Anders \& Grevesse 1989), the =45.8^ model
gives an iron line that is both too weak (W_ K =25 ) and
originates from too far out in the disk to be compatible with the line
variability (5 10^4-1 10^5r_g; see
Fig.~). On the other hand, the gravitational
stable warped disk of M08 predicts an iron line of the correct
strength (W_ K =51 ), originating from a region in the
disk that is compatible with both the line width and line variability
constraints ((1-4) 10^4r_g; Fig.~).
We note that in addition to the high viewing inclination, the geometry
of the warped disk implies that most of the observed iron line
emission is driven by highly oblique irradiation of the disk surface.
Thus, it is important to account for the dependence of the iron line
photon production on the angle of incidence of the irradiating X-ray
continuum (see Appendix). The high viewing inclination and the
oblique irradiation means that simple estimates of the line
strength based on covering fraction arguments are inappropriate.

Thus,we have shown that one can quantitatively understand the
properties of the iron line in NGC~4258 if it originates from the
surface layers of a warped disk irradiated by a central X-ray source.
We do require, however, a severe warp inside of the masing region of
the disk of the kind possessed by the M08 best-fitting gravitationally
stable model. Interestingly, as discussed in M08, this model implies a
significant mis-alignment between the inner accretion disk and the
jet.

The warped disk hypothesis for the origin of the iron line in NGC~4258
can be tested by future X-ray spectroscopy by searching for the
predicted asymmetric double-peaked line profile.
Fig.~ shows the predicted line profiles from
the two warped disk models of M08, both for a perfect
-function emission line at 6.4\,keV (left panel) and the real
Fe~K doublet with component energies of 6.392\,keV and
6.405\,keV and a 1:2 branching ratio (right panel). Future
high-resolution spectrographs (such as the micro-calorimeters on
Astro-H or International X-ray Observatory) will be able to
easily revolve the predicted line profiles.

The circumnuclear environment of NGC~4258

As discussed above, most if not all of the iron line emission in
NGC~4258 can be understood as originating from the warped accretion
disk. This leaves very little room for any iron fluorescence from
other (non-disk) cold matter in the system such as the putative
molecular torus of unified Seyfert schemes. Indeed, the circumnuclear
environment of this black hole does appear to be significantly
``cleaner'' than the vast majority of Seyfert-2 galaxies. Dadina
(2008) examines a sample of 62 Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with
BeppoSAX and finds a mean reflection fraction of R=0.87
0.14 (assuming face-on reflection) and a mean iron line equivalent
width of W_K =693 195 . The strong iron line and
Compton reflection signatures in most Seyfert 2 nuclei are readily
understood as originating from the obscuring molecular torus (Krolik,
Madau \& Zycki 1994). For NGC~4258, the fact that our almost edge-on
view of the central engine suffers absorption at ``only'' the
10^23 level already rules out a Compton-thick torus that is
aligned with the accretion disk. Furthermore, the very weak X-ray
reprocessing features ( R<0.43 and W_K =45 17
from our time-averaged Suzaku data) rules out the presence of
even a misaligned geometrically-thick Compton-thick torus.

A comparison with M81* and other AGN

It is interesting to compare NGC 4258 with the LLAGN M81*, since both
seem to have very clean nuclear environments. M81 is classified as a
Seyfert 1.8 / Low-Ionization Emission Line Region (LINER) galaxy, with
a central black hole mass of M = 7 10^7 M_ (Devereux et
al. 2003) accreting at L 10^-5 L_ Edd. M81* shows
evidence of a one-sided radio jet emanating from the nucleus
(Bietenholz, Bartel \& Rupen 2000). High-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy of M81* with Chandra (Young et al. 2007) reveals a
number of emission lines, including Fe K , and velocity
broadened Si K and other thermal lines. The Fe K line
in M81* has an EW of 47^+25_-24 eV, almost identical to that of
NGC 4258, and there is no evidence of a broad iron line. Furthermore,
the broadened Si K fluorescence line in M81* is consistent
with originating in a disk at r 10^4 r_g, assuming the
inclination angle is the same as the disk observed with HST, i =
14^ (Devereux et al. 2003). The broadened thermal lines in M81*
are consistent with originating at r < 10^4-5 r_g, suggesting that
there is hot thermal gas at small radii, possibly in the form of a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the base of a jet (Markoff
et al. 2008).

The inclination angles of the outer accretion disk in NGC 4258 (
80^ ), and in M81, (14^ ) are significantly different, and
this may account for the fact that NGC 4258 has a much larger column
density ( 10^23 cm^-2) than M81 ( 10^21
cm^-2), that maser emission is not seen in M81, and the difference
in the obscuration of the broad line region (i.e., the Seyfert types).
In M81*, we do not know the geometry of the disk well enough to
calculate the strength of the Fe K line that it would produce.
Apart from their different inclination angles, the accretion flows in
NGC 4258 and M81* seem to be remarkably similar.

Although we have noted the similarities between the circumnuclear
environments of NGC4258 and M81*, it is interesting that these results
on NGC4258 and M81* appear to run counter to some general behaviour of
the AGN population. In particular, it has been noted that the
strength of the iron emission line across the AGN population is
anticorrelated with both the X-ray luminosity (Iwasawa \& Taniguchi
1993) and the Eddington ratio (Winter et al. 2008). Using the
Swift-BAT AGN survey, Winter et al. (2008) show that LLAGN with X-ray
Eddington ratios comparable to NGC~4258 (L_X/L_ Edd
10^-5) typically possess iron line equivalent widths in excess of
500\,eV. Thus, on the basis of the iron line equivalent width, the
circumnuclear environments of NGC~4258 and M81* appear to have
significantly less cold gas than the average LLAGN.

Conclusions

Using Suzaku, XMM-Newton and Swift, we have obtained
an unprecedented view of the active nucleus in NGC~4258. Our
principal results are:

Comparing the Suzaku data with XMM-Newton data taken
160 days later, we detect robust flux variability of the 6.4\,keV iron
line for the first time. Together with constraints on the velocity
width of the line, and assuming Keplerian motion about the central
black hole, we can place the iron line emitting region to be between
3 10^3r_g and 4 10^4r_g.
We show that the strength, velocity width and time variability
of the iron line can be explained by a model in which the line
originates from the surface of a warped accretion disk. In
particular, we present explicit calculations of the expected iron line
from a disk warped by Lens-Thirring precession from a severely
misaligned central black hole.
During our Suzaku observation, we detect high amplitude
intraday variability, with fluctuations on timescales as short as
5\,ks. Corresponding light travel time arguments suggest that the
emission region is smaller than 25r_g. If we make the stronger
assertion that this timescale be longer than the dynamical timescale
of the accretion disk at the location it is produced, the upper limit
on the radius of the emission is 10r_g$.
In stark contrast with the vast majority of other Seyfert 2
galaxies, there are no indications of a Compton-thick obscuring torus;
the weak iron line and the lack of reflection all point to a
circumnuclear environment that is remarkable clean of cold gas. As
pointed out by Herrnstein et al. (2005), the intrinsic absorption that
we do see in the X-ray spectrum may well arise in the outer layers of
the warped geometrically-thin accretion disk, further reducing the
need for any cold structure other than the accretion disk itself.
We highlight the similarities in the circumnuclear environments
of NGC~4258 and another LLAGN, M81*. However, we also note that the
remarkably clean circumnuclear environment found in these two LLAGN
stand in contrast to the vast majority of LLAGN.
