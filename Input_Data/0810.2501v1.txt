We briefly describe the energy loss processes of ultrahigh energy
protons, heavier nuclei and gamma rays in interactions with
the universal photon fields of the Universe. We then discuss
the modification of the accelerated cosmic ray energy spectrum
in propagation by the energy loss processes and the charged
cosmic ray scattering in the extragalactic magnetic fields.
The energy lost by the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays goes
into gamma rays and neutrinos that carry additional
information about the sources of highest energy particles.
The new experimental results of the HiRes and the Auger
collaborations are discussed in view of the predictions
from propagation calculations.

Introduction

The high interest of the astrophysical community to the
Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) developed after the Agasa
experiment showed its energy spectrum that continued above
10^20 eV without a break~ and with no indication
of a GZK~ structure. This is not the first time cosmic
rays of such high energy were observed. John Linsley reported
on the first extensive air shower above 10^20 eV in 1963~.
Three years later Greisen, and independently Zatsepin \& Kuzmin,
predicted the end of the cosmic ray spectrum that results
from the interactions of the UHECR with the microwave background
radiation (MBR). Every giant air shower experiment has reported
events exceeding 10^20 eV since that time. Because of the
very low flux of such particles and the various energy estimates
of different experiment it was impossible to judge if these
highest energy nuclei in the Universe obey the GZK predictions -
a sharp decline of the spectrum above 4 10^19 eV or not.
At the time Agasa was the highest exposure experiment and it claimed
a spectrum that is not consistent with the GZK cut-off.

This result was not confirmed by the contemporary leaders in
UHECR statistics, the Auger and the HiRes experiments.
Both these groups have published UHECR spectra that seems to be
consistent with the GZK prediction. There are, however, distinct
differences between the results of these two groups that
create new challenges for the scientists who are eager to
establish in some detail the acceleration and propagation
picture of UHECR.

It has been a common suspicion for more than 50 years that
the highest energy cosmic rays are of extragalactic origin~.
The argument is that our Galaxy is not large enough and the
galactic magnetic fields are not strong enough to contain
particles of such high energy and thus accelerate them.
The gyro radius R_g of a 10^20 eV proton in 3 field
is higher than 30 kpc, similar to the dimension of the whole
Galaxy that does not contain shocks of the same dimension.

If UHECR are indeed of extragalactic origin they should suffer
from the interactions with the MBR unless their sources are
cosmologically very close to us. For this reason a comparison
of the detected UHECR spectrum with theoretical calculations
of the particle propagation in extragalactic space should at
least point at the distance distribution of their sources and
bring us closer to the source identification. From that point
of view the small differences between the HiRes~
and Auger~ spectra lead us to very different
interpretations.

Figure~ shows the published spectra and the rough
fits of the observed spectra that are suggested by the two
experimental groups. It is obvious that the extremely small
statistics around 10^20 eV makes the fit of the strong
decline above 10^19.6 eV very difficult. The statistics
around 10^18.5 eV, on the other hand, is significant and
the different behavior of the spectra is confusing in addition
to the different normalizations of the spectra.

Another major difference between the two experiments is their
estimate of the chemical composition of UHECR studied from the
measured depth of shower maximum X_max. HiRes derives
a pure proton composition~, while
the Auger analysis tends to reveal a more complex mixed
nuclear composition~. The UHECR composition
at their sources affects the interpretation of the spectra
because protons and heavier nuclei have different energy
loss mechanisms.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses
the energy loss of different possible primary particles.
The next section describes the formation of the ultrahigh
energy cosmic ray spectrum on propagation and the astrophysical
parameters that are important for it. Section 4 is dedicated
to the production of secondary particle fluxes in propagation,
and mostly to cosmogenic neutrinos. Section 5 contains a brief
summary of the current knowledge.

UHECR energy loss

Apart from the adiabatic energy loss due to the expansion of
the universe there are two important processes for protons:
photoproduction interactions and e^+e^- pair production (BH)
interactions identical to the pair production interactions
of --rays in the nuclear field.
The back of the envelope estimate of the photoproduction energy
loss goes like this:
The average interaction length _ph
for interactions with the MBR
is the inverse of the product of the interaction cross section
_ph and the photon density n. For _ph =
10^-28~cm^2 and n = 400~cm^-3 _ph = 8.3~Mpc.
Since protons lose about 0.2 of their energy in each interaction
it takes about ten interaction length to decrease the particle
energy by a factor of 10.

The story of the heavier nuclei energy loss is more complicated.
In addition to these two processes heavy nuclei lose energy in
photo disintegration (spallation) processes, i.e. when the
center of mass energy exceeds the giant dipole resonance the
nucleus can lose a nucleon. Since less energy is required
in the center of mass the cross section is higher but
the energy loss depends on the mass of the nucleus that loses
only one or two nucleons. The photoproduction energy loss follows the
same energy dependence as for protons but in the Lorentz factor
space, i.e. in E/A units. The pair production cross section
is a quadratic function of the charge of the nucleus Z.

In the case of exotic theoretical top-down models UHECR
are gamma rays from the decay of very heavy X--particles.
Although the --ray fraction was strongly limited by
the Auger Collaboration to not more than 2\
10^19 eV this possibility can not be
totally excluded. In such a case the energy loss is due to the
e^+e^- process.

Proton energy loss length

A photoproduction interaction is possible when at least one pion is
generated in the process. This requires that the center of mass
energy of the interaction s is higher that the sum of a
proton mass m_p and a pion mass m_ . In the laboratory system
the square of the center of mass energy s is

s \; = \; m_p^2 + 2 E_p (1 - )\; ,

where is the photon energy and is the angle between
the proton and the photon. In a head on collision ( = -1)
with a photon of the average MBR energy (6.3 10^-4~eV) the
minimum proton energy is

E_p \; = \; m_ 4 (2 m_p + m_ ) \; \;
10^ 20\; eV.

There are many MBR photons with higher energy and the threshold
proton energy is actually lower, about 3 10^19 eV.

The cross section for this interaction is very well studied at accelerators
where photons interact with stationary protons. The highest cross section
is at the mass of the ^+ resonance (1232 MeV) which decays to
either a proton and a neutral pion (p ^0) or to a neutron and a
positive pion (n ^+). At the peak of the resonance the cross section
is about 500 . At higher energy the cross section first decreases
to about 100 and then increases logarithmically. The neutron
interaction cross section is, if not identical, very similar to the
proton one.

The MBR spectrum and density are also very well known, so the proton
interaction length can be calculated exactly, as shown in the left hand
panel of Fig.~ with dash line. Since protons lose only
a fraction of their energy (K_inel), another quantity - the energy loss
length L_loss \; = \; - 1E dEdx becomes important.
The energy loss length is longer than the interaction length by
1/K_inel, by about a factor of 5 at threshold. At higher energy
K_inel grows and this factor is about 2.

In the case of e^+e^- pair production~
the addition of two electron masses to the center of mass energy s
requires much lower proton energy and the process has lower threshold.
The cross section for pair production is higher than _ph,
but the fractional energy loss is small, of order of the ratio of the
electron to proton mass m_e/m_p. The energy loss length has a minimum
around 2 10^19~eV and is always longer than 1,000 Mpc.

The last proton energy loss process is the redshift due to the expansion
of the Universe. The current energy loss length to redshift is the
ratio of the velocity of light to the Hubble constant (c/H_0) and is
4,000 Mpc for H_0 = 75 km.s^-1Mpc^-1.

The energy loss of protons in the MBR is shown in the left hand
panel of Fig.~. This figure shows also the
photoproduction interaction length and the decay length of
neutrons. The neutron photoproduction cross section is almost
identical to the proton one. This means that neutrons of energy
less than 4 10^20 will most likely decay and only
neutrons of higher energy are likely to have
photoproduction interactions.

Energy loss length of heavier nuclei

The energy loss length of heavier nuclei is shown in the
right hand panel of Fig.~ as calculated in
Ref.~. Its minimum value is significantly
lower than that of protons but is achieved at higher energy:
A E_p. It is, of course, not obvious that
such high energy could be achieved at UHECR acceleration,
although we always assume that the maximum acceleration energy
is proportional to the charge Z of the nucleus.

The effect of propagation on the accelerated UHECR can not
be calculated directly from the energy loss lengths shown in
Fig.~ because an accelerated nucleus changes its mass
after the first photo disintegration interactions. This means
that the code that treats propagation of nuclei should be able
to calculate the cross sections for all nuclei and isotopes
lighter than the injected nucleus. In addition to the cross
sections for losing one, two, and more nucleons the codes should
evaluate the decay probability for unstable nuclei that may
be generated in the propagation.

Many of the cross sections necessary for a correct simulation
of the propagation of nuclei have been experimentally studied
at accelerators. There is still a need for approximations for
some of the numerous processes taking place in the
propagation of nuclei. See, e.g. the early work on propagation
of nuclei~ that is based on such approximations.

Gamma ray energy loss length

The process has e^+e^- has a
resonant character and the cross section peaks at E_ \; = \;
2 m_e^2, where is the energy of the seed photons.
For the average energy of MBR this corresponds to E_ of
8 10^14~eV and the mean free path decreases with increasing
E_ . For gamma rays of energy 10^20~eV the relevant seed
photon frequency is about 1 MHz - in the radio band.
This creates a big uncertainty in the estimates of the UHE -ray
energy loss length because the density of the radio background at such
frequencies is not known. One can relate the radio emission of various
astrophysical objects to the much better known infrared emission and
generate models to calculate the energy loss length. The results of
such modeling are energy loss lengths of order that of protons.

A different source of uncertainty in the -ray propagation
is the strength of the extragalactic magnetic fields. If they are
negligible the electrons have inverse Compton interactions,
whose interaction length is similar to that of the pair production,
and generate a second generation of very high energy -rays.
This cascading can continue for a significant
distance without downgrading very much the gamma ray energy. If, however,
the magnetic fields are significant electrons lose energy very fast on
synchrotron radiation. The -ray energy is rapidly transferred
to the MeV-GeV energy range. The range of top-down cosmic ray generation
models has been restricted because of overproduction of GeV -rays.
The energy loss distance on synchrotron
radiation is 2.6E_18^-1 B_-9^-2~Mpc, where E_18 is the
electron energy in unites of 10^18~eV and B_-9 is the strength
of magnetic field in nGauss.

Formation of the cosmic ray energy spectrum after propagation

Predictions of the shape of the cosmic ray spectrum requires much
more than the energy loss in propagation. The necessary astrophysical
input, currently unknown,
includes et least the following four items:
\ \ \ \ UHECR source distribution
\ \ \ \ cosmic ray source luminosity
\ \ \ \ cosmic ray injection (acceleration) spectrum
\ \ \ \ maximum acceleration energy E_max
\ \ \ \ cosmic ray chemical composition
\ \ \ \ cosmic ray source cosmological evolution.

The UHECR source distribution was the least known one.
After Auger found a correlation with nearby (redshift z less than
0.018) active galactic nuclei (AGN)of their highest energy
events~
the situation changed. Although there is no certainty that these
AGN are indeed the sources of UHECR, this is the first time we
have a suggestion
what the source distribution could be.

The other five parameters are not independent of each other. The UHECR
source luminosity can in principle be determined by the detected UHECR flux
above 10^19 eV. In view of the low current statistics, the derived
luminosity depends strongly on the assumed injection spectrum and
composition and partially
on the assumed cosmological evolution of the sources~. The source
cosmological evolution may be the best known parameter since it should
resemble these of other astrophysical phenomena such as the star formation
rate in the Universe.

Formation of the proton spectrum in propagation

As an example we will discuss the formation of the cosmic ray spectrum
in the case all UHECR are protons. The left hand panel of Fig.~
shows the evolution of a monochromatic protons of injection
energy 10^21.5 eV after propagation from different redshifts.
After propagation on z=0.0005 (appr. 2 Mpc) a large fraction
(appr. 60\
Some of them, however, have interacted a couple of times and
their energy has decreased as much as a factor of 10 as such high
energy protons lose much more than 20\
photoproduction interactions.
Almost all protons have interacted at z=0.0078 and the average
proton energy at this distance is 2 10^20 eV.
In further propagation the energy distribution at arrival
becomes narrower as the highly stochastic photoproduction
energy loss becomes lower than the almost continuous pair production,
and later the adiabatic loss from the expansion of the Universe.
The width of the arrival energy decreases until the pair production
energy loss length is smaller than that of the adiabatic energy
loss length.

One can see in the right hand panel how the sums of the contributions
of low redshifts exceeds the value of the injected spectrum after
a propagation to z=0.1. In models with the cosmological evolution
the effect is stronger and proportional to the strength of the
source evolution.

A natural assumption for the source distribution, the result of which
is shown in Fig.~ is that sources are
isotropically and homogeneously distributed in the Universe because
we do not inhabit a special part of it, and the contribution of
all sources are identical. In such a case the cosmic ray
flux at Earth could be determined by an integration of the fluxes
from different redshifts
shown in the right hand panel of Fig.~. In the case of
cosmological evolution of the sources the integral is

N(E) \; = \; ^z_max_0 _E^E_0 L(z) N_0(E_0) P(E_0, E', z)
dtdz dE' dz \; ,

where L(z) is the cosmic ray source luminosity as a function of redshift
and N_0(E_0) reflects the injection spectrum, P(E_0,E',z) is the
probability for a proton injected with energy E_0 at redshift z to
reach us with energy E'.
The derivative dt/dz depends on the cosmological model
and is
$ dt dz \; = \; 1 H_o (1 + z)
[ _M (1+z)^3 + _ ] ^-1/2
and is simplified to (1+z)^-5/2/(H_o(1 + z)) for the
Einstein-deSitter Universe.

It is important to note that contribution of different redshifts
depends not only on the cosmological evolution but also on the
injection spectral index as the photoproduction energy loss is
a strong function of the injection energy. Since in steep
injection spectra a larger fraction of the observed flux
comes from lower primary energy (that do not change as much
on propagation) the contribution of higher redshifts is larger.

One can see in the right hand panel of Fig.~ that
even z=0.05 does contribute to UHECR above 6 10^19 eV
which was observed by Auger to be correlated to AGN within
distances of only 71 Mpc (z 0.017). There are several ways
to deal with
this seeming controversy. One would be to claim that the energy
scale of Auger is not correct and it should be higher by about 25-30\
This would make the contributions of higher redshifts smaller
and bring the GZK sphere closer to the expectations for protons.

Another is to claim that the feature observed by Auger and HiRes is not
a result of the GZK process, as the experimental groups claim, and is just
the end of the acceleration
power of the sources that does not much exceed 10^20 eV. The
shape of the spectra observed by both experiments (that are
shown in Fig.~) is, however,
very close to what we expect from the GZK cutoff.
If one attempts to fit these spectra with the same model some
problems start showing up. The model of Berezinsky et al~
that has pure proton composition with steep injection
spectrum (E^-2.7) fits perfectly the HiRes spectrum
and does not require other contributions (such as galactic cosmic
rays) above 10^18 eV.
The same model, however, does not appear to fit well the
current Auger data.

One can also involve the extragalactic magnetic fields in the
explanation. If it is high the UHECR would scatter
often and their real pathlength would be considerably larger
than the distance to the sources.

Propagation in magnetic fields

Our knowledge of the extragalactic magnetic fields is quite
limited. We do know that they exist and are most likely
proportional to the mass density in the Universe, i.e.
high in regions of high matter concentration ans low in voids.
Magnetic fields introduce three main effects. The cosmic ray
scattering increases the propagation pathlength and thus
restricts the radius of the possible sources. The scattering
creates a deviation of the arrival direction of the UHECR
from the direction of the source. The gyro radius of a 10^20~eV
proton in 10^-9 G (nG) field is 100 Mpc.
If the field is random with a correlation length
the deviation angle after propagation on
distance D is

\; \; 2.5^
B_-9 D_100^ 12 _1^ 12 E_20^-1 \; ,

where B_-9 is the r.m.s. field strength in nG, D_100
is the distance in units of 100 Mpc, _1 is the correlation
length in units of 1 Mpc and E_20 is the energy in units of
10^20~eV. Protons below 10^20 eV would scatter much more
around the direction of the source but the highest energy particles
would point at the source with an angle comparable to the experimental
resolution. The scattering angles for heavier nuclei are
proportional to their charge.

The scattering also introduces time delay compared to the rectilinear
propagation of light. The time delay has a much
stronger dependence
on the particle energy, magnetic field strength and
the propagation distance. For small angle scattering it is

\; \; 3 10^5
B_-9^2 D_100^2 _1 E_20^-2\; years.

If the source of the observed UHECR were an explosive process,
such as a gamma ray burst at a distance of 100 Mpc, all protons
would accelerated at once, but because of time delay they would
arrive at Earth in a reverse order of their energy. The highest
energy particles would reach us first, while the lower energy ones
would be delayed with millions of years. It is important to note that
the time delay depends on the square of the particle charge.
Iron nuclei coming from 10 Mpc will be still delayed
seven times more than protons arriving from 100 Mpc.

Time delays could prevent some of the extragalactic protons
from reaching us, because their travel time could exceed
the the age of the Universe. Particles of energy below
5.5 10^17 eV from the gamma ray burst at 100 Mpc,
for example, propagating in 1 nG field will not reach us
because their time delay will
exceed Hubble time, taken here of 10^10 yrs for simplicity.

In a simulation that propagated protons in 1 nG random
field~ we calculated the proton horizon
R_50, which is the distance at which 1/e fraction of
protons maintain at least one half of their injection
energy. This distance is smaller than the proton energy loss
length even for 10^20 eV protons. The ratio R_50 to
the energy loss length in 1 nG field is proportional to E^-1.2
at the approach to 10^20 eV. Using Eq.~ one
can estimate the additional pathlength in 1 nG field for
6 10^19 eV (60 EeV) protons emitted at distance of
70 Mpc to 66 kpc. This does not make a huge difference but
remember that in 10 nG field it would grow to 6.6 Mpc. For
iron and 1 nG field the additional pathlength would increase to
45 Mpc - for a total pathlength of 115 Mpc.

The numbers quoted above do not include the cosmic ray energy loss
which contributes significantly to the low R_50 values.
At 60 EeV R_50 is only 35\
and would be less than a Mpc for Fe nuclei.

The magnetic field of our Galaxy is a good example for a combination
of organized and random magnetic fields, which most likely exist on
different scales in the Universe. The regular field B_reg in the
Galaxy has a spiral structure of axisymmetric or bisymmetric type
resembling the matter distribution. The local strength of the field
is about 1.8 with direction pointing inwards approximately
along the Orion arm. The strength of the random field is not known
exactly, with estimates between 1/2 and 2 B_reg. The correlation
length of the random galactic fields is of order 50 to 100 pc.
More general estimates of the total field strength over the whole
Galaxy give 5-6 ~,
and it is possible that a galactic halo field,
that does not contribute much locally, also exists. It is likely that
the random field dominates the total field strength within the
galactic arms, while the regular field is dominant in the inter arm
space.

In a 5 galactic field the gyro radius of a 10^20 eV proton
would be 20 kpc. The real deflection depends on the distance of
the proton trajectory from the galactic center and on the pitch
angle of the trajectory to the regular field.
The Auger analysis attributes scattering angle of about 3^o to
their events above 60 EeV which often pass relatively close to the
galactic center. This is consistent with the correlation angle
with nearby AGN measured by the collaboration. Events in the HiRes
field of view will on the average smaller scattering than those
of Auger.

The amount of scattering depends strongly on the exact magnetic field model.
Field models with alternating polarity, such as BSS~
give the smallest deflections. Models with a z component
of the field (perpendicular to the galactic plane, that may be due
to a dipole field) cause the largest ones.

The possible existence of regular large scale fields makes the
consequences of proton propagation even more complicated.
The following exercise in Ref.~ demonstrates the problems
in the following geometry: a cosmic ray
source at the origin injects isotropically protons above 10^18.5 eV
on a power law spectrum with spectral index of 2 and exponential
cutoff at 10^21.5 eV. The source is in the central yz plane of
a 3 Mpc wide magnetic wall, that is a simplified version of the
Supergalactic plane (SGP), which is the plane of weight
of galaxies within redshift of 0.04. Magnetic field with strength of
B_reg = 10 nG fills the SGP, points in z direction and decays
exponentially outside the SGP. The regular field is accompanied by
random field with strength B_rndm = B_reg/2.

Under these conditions the protons leaving the 20 Mpc sphere
have not only very large deflections, but also modified energy
spectra. Protons with trajectories perpendicular to the
magnetic field lines exhibit much flatter spectrum since the lower
energy protons are caught up in the magnetic walls. Protons
with trajectories parallel to the magnetic field lines have
softer spectra that include the particles that could not penetrate
the supergalactic plane.

In these simple cases one can scale the effects in proton energy
as a function of the magnetic field strength. If B_reg were 1 ,
for example, all effects would be the same in a 200 kpc sphere.
There are lobes of radio galaxies, including Cen A, that have
bigger lobes that may have ordered magnetic fields of that strength
and may also cause significant deflections and modifications
of the injection spectra depending on the position of the
observer.

Production of secondary fluxes in propagation

The energy that UHECR lose in propagation ends up in fluxes of
gamma rays and neutrinos from ^0 and ^ as well as
other charged and neutral mesons decays.
Gamma rays have even shorter energy loss length than nuclei
and develop pair production/inverse Compton cascades where
synchrotron radiation may play important role. In the presence
of noticeable (1 nG) extragalactic field 10^18 eV electrons
quickly lose energy to GeV synchrotron photons.

Neutrinos, however, have very low interaction cross section
and arrive at Earth with just redshift energy loss from
almost any distance. For this reason the cosmological
evolution of the cosmic ray sources are very important input
in the calculation of these cosmogenic~
neutrinos.

The left hand panel of Fig.~ shows what fraction of the
injection energy of E^-2 cosmic ray spectrum above 10^19
is contained in nucleons and secondary particles. After propagation
on 200 Mpc less than 50\
nucleons. The rest is distributed between neutrinos, gamma rays
and electron-positron pairs. The largest fraction of the energy loss
is in gamma rays from neutral meson decays. The reason for this
is that the ^+ decays to p + ^0 twice as often
as it decays to n + ^+. The muon neutrino flux consists
of approximately equal numbers of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos.
The electron neutrino flux is mostly electron neutrinos.

The production of cosmogenic particle fluxes depends
on the same general astrophysical parameters as the
cosmic ray flux. The main difference is that the
cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources is
much more important. As we saw above UHE cosmic rays
arrive only from very small redshifts, where even very strong
cosmological evolution would make 10\
cosmogenic neutrinos may easily come from z=2 which would
correspond to an increase of order of magnitude or more.

The infrared background (IRB) is also a target worth considering
when the production of cosmogenic neutrinos is discussed.
Its number density is a factor of 400 or more less than
that of the MBR, but its energy is significantly higher.
This means that lower energy nucleons will occasionally
interact on IRB photons and generate lower energy neutrinos.
Since even in a flat ( =1) injection spectrum
there are many more lower energy protons the contribution
of interactions in IRB to the cosmogenic
neutrino flux, although of lower energy, may be significant.
The contribution of IRB increases with the steepness of the
UHECR spectrum.


Two among the Auger results presented above may have an
important connection to the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos -
the correlation of the highest Auger events with nearby
AGN and the high cosmological evolution
required by one of the spectrum fits with relatively
flat proton injection spectrum.

The cosmological evolution of different types of astrophysical
objects is studied mostly in star forming regions (SFR) by
infrared observations or in AGNs from their X-ray emission.
The cosmological evolution of SFR is derived as (1 + z)^3
on the average for up to redshifts close to 2.

It is indeed impossible to judge what is the best proxy for
the cosmic rays source evolution, infrared radiation or
X-rays in the 0.5 - 2 KeV range where most of the statistics
is. The conclusions from the X-ray observations are that
the evolution of AGN is close to (1 + z)^5~.
Very powerful AGN have even a stronger evolution but the large
number of AGN correlating with the Auger UHECR require
using the evolution of average ones.

It may be just a coincidence, but the Auger collaboration
analysis of the spectrum shown in Fig.~
can be best described by two proton models~: one with
= 1.55 and no cosmological evolution, and
another on with =1.3 and cosmological evolution
(1 + z)^5, the same as that of AGN.
The right hand panel of Fig.~ shows the
cosmogenic neutrino spectra generated by these two models.
The higher energy peak of these energy spectra consists
mostly of _ , _ , and _e from
charged meson decays. The peak at about 10^15 eV consists
only of _e from neutron decay.

The difference between the two neutrino models is huge, almost two
orders of magnitude at maximum. One can also see the redshift
of the maximum in the =1.3 model where most of the neutrinos
are generated at high redshift. This also shows up in the lower
energy _e peak that is enhanced because of the
higher number of protons (and respectively secondary neutrons)
injected at high redshifts. The =1.55 model flux
will significantly increase if the production in IRB is included.
This would, however, be at lower energy and the detection rate will
not change a lot.

The two other models that fit the Auger spectrum are mixed composition
ones. If UHECR are heavy nuclei they generate a few cosmogenic neutrinos
and only the proton fraction is efficient in production of meson
decay neutrinos. Since there are many neutrons that are released in
the spallation process there is a significant flux of _e
from neutron decay. There are several
calculations~
of the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes from mixed composition models that
show this effect.

A possible detection even of a few cosmogenic neutrinos would
greatly help the interpretation of the detected UHECR fluxes.
Because of the big difference in the neutrino flux only models
with strong cosmological evolution may lead to detection.
For those without cosmological evolution we need Gigaton
neutrino detectors.

Summary


36pt All known stable particles that are candidates for the
ultra high energy cosmic rays lose energy in interactions with
the cosmic microwave background and other astrophysical photon fields.


36pt The cosmic rays spectrum measured by the HiRes collaboration
agrees very well with a model of pure proton composition while the
Auger collaboration spectrum may require mixed primary composition.


36pt The energy loss sets a horizon for the sources of such
particles (a maximum distance from the observer) and modify the
injection spectrum of these cosmic rays.


36pt Charged UHECR, such as protons and heavier nuclei,
scatter
in the extragalactic magnetic fields. This scattering causes increased
pathlength, decreases the particle horizon, and introduces deflection
from the source direction and significant time delay.


36pt The cosmogenic neutrino fluxes generated in cosmic rays
propagation are currently close to detection in the km^3 detectors
if the models with strong cosmological evolution of UHECR are correct.


36pt Only protons of energy approaching 10^20 eV reveal
the source position and spectrum after an account for the energy loss
and scattering in propagation.


36pt $ The identification of the UHECR sources will bring
very valuable general information about the power and size of the
sources and the magnetic fields in them, as well in the intergalactic
space.
