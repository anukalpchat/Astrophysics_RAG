Updating Kormendy \& Kennicutt (2004, ARA\&A, 42, 603), we review internal secular
evolution of galaxy disks. One consequence is the growth of pseudobulges that often
are mistaken for true (merger-built) bulges. Many pseudobulges are recognizable
as cold, rapidly rotating, disky structures. Bulges have S\'ersic function brightness
profiles with index
n 2 while most pseudobulges have n 2.
Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy
formation more acute: How can hierarchical clustering make so many pure disk galaxies
with no evidence for merger-built bulges? E. g., the giant Scd galaxies
M 101 and NGC 6946 have rotation velocities of V_ circ 200 km~s^-1
but nuclear star clusters with velocity dispersions of 25 to 40 km s^-1.
Within 8 Mpc of us, 11 of 19 galaxies with V_ circ > 150 km~s^-1 show
no evidence for a classical bulge, one may contain a classical plus a
pseudo bulge, and 7 are ellipticals or have classical bulges. So it is hard to
understand how bulgeless galaxies could form as the quiescent tail of a
distribution of merger histories.
Our second theme is environmental secular evolution. We confirm that spheroidal
galaxies have fundamental plane correlations that are almost perpendicular to those for
bulges and elliptical galaxies. Spheroidals are not dwarf ellipticals. Rather, their
structural parameters are similar to those of late-type galaxies. We suggest that
spheroidals are defunct late-type galaxies transformed by internal processes such as
supernova-driven gas ejection and environmental processes such as secular harassment
and ram-pressure stripping.
Minus spheroidals, the fundamental plane correlations for ellipticals and bulges
have small scatter. With respect to these, pseudobulges are larger and less dense.
They fade out by becoming fluffy, not by becoming compact, like nuclei. Pseudobulges
and nuclear star clusters appear to have different origins.

Internal and Environmental Secular Evolution

Internal, slow (secular) evolution of galaxy disks occurs when
nonaxisymmetries such as bars and spiral structure redistribute energy and angular
momentum and rearrange disk structure. Environmentally driven evolution can also
be secular (e. g., galaxy harassment), although better known processes
are rapid (mergers). We concentrate on one consequence of environmental secular evolution.
It is one of several processes that can transform late-type dwarfs into ``spheroidals'',
i. e., galaxies that are morphologically similar to ellipticals
but that have different structural parameter correlations indicative of different
formation physics. Figure 1 puts these galaxy formation processes into a more
general context.

Internal Secular Evolution and the Growth of Pseudobulges

=15000 =15000

Aspects of internal secular evolution have long been thriving
``cottage industries'' (an early review is in Kormendy 1982).
Kormendy \& Kennicutt (2004) provide a synthesis of these many lines
of research, both observational and theoretical. Other reviews are in
Sellwood \& Wilkinson (1993), Kormendy (1993), Buta \& Combes (1996)
Kormendy \& Cornell (2004), Kormendy \& Fisher (2005), Athanassoula (2007),
Peletier (2008), and Combes (2007, 2008). With limited space,
this paper concentrates on new observations of pseudobulge properties.

Whatever the engine, internal evolution has similar consequences.
Like all self-gravitating systems, galaxy disks tend to spread -- the outsides
expand and the insides contract (Tremaine 1989). This is as fundamental to disk
evolution as core collapse is to globular clusters, as the production of hot
Jupiters and colder Neptunes is to the evolution of planetary systems, and
as evolution to red giants containing proto-white-dwarfs is to stellar evolution
(Kormendy \& Fisher 2005; Kormendy 2008). In galaxy disks, gas infall and
star formation builds dense central components that get mistaken for
bulges but that were not made by galaxy mergers. They come in several varieties
depending on what drives the evolution. Pseudobulges made from disk gas are often
but not always disky (Kormendy 1993; KK04; Fisher
\& Drory 2008a). Box-shaped bulges also are disk phenomena:~they
are parts of edge-on bars
(Combes \& Sanders 1981;
Combes et al.~1990;
Pfenniger \& Friedli 1991;
Raha et al.~1991;
Kuijken \& Merrifield 1995;
Merrifield \& Kuijken 1999;
Bureau \& Freeman 1999;
Bureau, Freeman, \& Athanassoula 1999;
Athanassoula 2005, 2007). Nuclear bars are connected with disky pseudobulges
(they rotate rapidly) and may be a subset of them. Other morphology that
identifies pseudobulges includes nuclear star formation rings and spiral structure.
It is convenient to have one name -- ``pseudobulges'' -- for all central,
high-density products of disk secular evolution.

How to identify pseudobulges is discussed in KK04. Prototypical examples that
are more disky than classical bulges were first recognized by their rapid rotation
(Figure 2). Disks have large V_ max/ and plot above the oblate line
when seen at inclinations other than edge-on. Early identification of very disky
(e. g., NGC~4736, NGC 3945) and moderately disky (e. g., NGC 2950,
also a nuclear bar) pseudobulges have recently been augmented as shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2 is an approximate analysis based on long-slit, major-axis spectra.
Integral-field spectroscopy from the SAURON team now provides beautifully detailed
detections of rapidly rotating, disky pseudobulges. Often (Figure 3), it is
exactly the high-surface-brightness center -- where the projected
brightness profile rises above the inward extrapolation of the outer disk profile --
that shows rapid rotation and a corresponding inward decrease in velocity dispersion.
Many of these kinematically decoupled components are also younger than the rest of
the inner galaxy. Some counter-rotate (McDermid et al.~2006) and presumably are
made from accreted material. But the phenomenon is common in barred and oval galaxies
in which secular evolution is expected to be rapid. Besides NGC 4274 in Figure 3,
excellent examples include NGC 3623 (SABa in the optical but clearly SB(r) in 2MASS
J H K images:~Jarrett et al.~2003), and NGC 5689 (SB0). These
results are discussed in
Ganda et al.~(2006),
Falc\'on-Barroso et al.~(2006),
Peletier et al.~(2007a);
see Peletier (2008) and
Peletier et al.~(2007b, c) for reviews. Quoting Peletier
et al.~(2007c):~``SAURON observations show that 13 out of 24 Sa and Sab galaxies
[and a similar fraction of late-type spirals]
show a central local minimum in the velocity dispersion ~The sigma-drops are
probably due to central disks that formed from gas falling into the central regions
through a secular evolution process.''



Pseudobulges were also recognized photometrically in Kormendy (1993); progress since
then has been rapid (KK04). In many galaxies, the ``bulge'' is essentially as flat
as the disk and/or shows clearcut spiral structure. Both are signatures of high-density
disks -- classical bulges are dynamically hot and cannot have small-scale spiral structure.
These features are spectacular in HST surveys of the centers of spiral galaxies (Carollo
et al.~1997, 1998, 2001, 2002; Carollo 1999).
Figure 4 shows examples. These are Sa -- Sbc galaxies, so they should
contain substantial bulges. Instead, their centers look like star-forming spiral galaxies.
Contrast the definition of a classical bulge (Renzini 1999 following Sandage 1961): A bulge is
nothing more nor less than an elliptical galaxy that happens to live in the middle of a disk.

Classical and pseudo bulges can coexist (KK04; Kormendy et al.\ 2006; Erwin 2007),
but the morphology in Figure 4 is not due to nuclear disks embedded in classical
bulges that are hidden by the display parameters. Bulges have steep brightness profiles,
so bulge light would dilute the contrast in the spiral structure very strongly at smaller
radii. But the strength of the spiral structure depends little on radius:~essentially all of the
pseudobulge participates.

The imaging survey authors generally interpret disky bulges as consequences of secular
evolution. Courteau, de Jong, \& Broeils (1996) observe ``spiral structure continuing into
the central regions'' and ``invoke secular dynamical evolution and gas
inflow via angular momentum transfer and viscous transport'' as the explanation. Carollo
et al.~(2001) conclude that ``exponential-type bulge formation is taking place in the local
universe and that this process is consistent with being the outcome of secular evolution
within the disks''.

A ``proof of concept'' is largely in hand, so studies of secular evolution now concentrate
on star formation (reviewed in Fisher \& Drory 2008b) and on pseudobulge statistical properties.
In 4, we compare the fundamental plane parameter correlations of pseudobulges,
classical bulges, and ellipticals. First, we need to define what we mean by an elliptical.
This leads to our second theme on environmental secular evolution and the formation of
spheroidal galaxies ( 3).

Environmental Secular Evolution: Origin of Spheroidal Galaxies

Figure 5 shows fundamental plane projections
(Djorgovski \& Davis 1987;
Faber et al.~1987;
Djorgovski et al.~1988) and S\'ersic index versus total magnitude for various kinds of
stellar systems (adapted from Kormendy et al.~2008: KFCB).

Critical to the interpretation of this figure is high-accuracy photometry of
all known E and selected Sph galaxies in the Virgo cluster from KFCB. Composite HST and
ground-based profiles over large radius ranges provide accurate S\'ersic parameters.
Then the intrinsically small scatter of the fundamental plane (Saglia et al.~1993;
J rgensen et al.~1996) is seen in the top panel, which shows the plane almost edge-on.
Figure 5 confirms the results of Kormendy (1985, 1987), Binggeli \& Cameron (1991), and
Bender, Burstein, \& Faber (1992) that E and Sph galaxies satisfy different parameter
correlations. This result has been criticized by Jerjen \& Binggeli (1997),
Graham \& Guzm\'an (2003), Gavazzi et al.~(2005),
and Ferrarese et al.~(2006) in part because the n -- M_V correlation is continuous.
We agree. But the observation that n is not sensitive to the difference between E and Sph
galaxies does not mean that they are related. The fundamental plane correlations (top panels
and Figure 6) show that lower-luminosity Es are monotonically higher in density, whereas
lower-luminosity Sphs are monotonically lower in density. Spheroidals are not
faint ellipticals. Instead, Kormendy (1985, 1987) showed that they have similar parameter
correlations to dwarf spiral and irregular galaxies. Spheroidals and ellipticals almost
certainly had very different formation processes. We believe that Es formed via major
galaxy mergers. Evidence discussed in KFCB suggests that spheroidal galaxies are defunct
late-type galaxies transformed by internal processes such as supernova-driven gas ejection
(Dekel \& Silk 1986) and environmental processes such as secular galaxy harassment
(Moore et al.~1996, 1998) and ram-pressure gas stripping (e. g., Chung et al.~2008).





Fundamental Plane Correlations for Bulges and Pseudobulges

=15000 =15000

Figures 5 and 6 compare parameter correlations for ellipticals, classical bulges,
and pseudobulges. S\'ersic parameters of (pseudo)bulges are less accurate than those
of Es, because deriving them requires a decomposition of brightness profiles into
(pseudo)bulge and disk contributions. We have reduced leverage on bulge parameters,
and they are strongly coupled to the disk parameters.
Nevertheless, Figures 5 and 6 show that classical bulges are indeed indistinguishable
from elliptical galaxies, consistent with our definition. Many pseudobulges are not very
different, either; this is one reason why they got confused with bulges. To find the
difference between pseudobulges and classical bulges, we need to look beyond
fundamental plane parameters and consider properties such as flattening and V/ .
Nevertheless, in Figures~5~and~6, pseudobulges also show larger scatter than classical
bulges, and they have smaller S\'ersic indices. Consistent with Courteau et al.~(1996),
MacArthur, Courteau, \& Holtzman (2003), and the Carollo team papers, Fisher \& Drory (2007a)
find a relatively clean separation between classical bulges with n 2
and pseudobulges (mostly) with n 2. Note that this conclusion
would not be clear if we believed that spheroidals are faint ellipticals. In the above,
the bulge-pseudobulge distinction is based on morphological criteria listed in KK04 and
not on profile shape. We do not understand galaxy formation well enough to predict n
for either type of bulge, but the distinction is clearcut enough to be a classification
aid.

Figure 6 shows that pseudobulges fade out by becoming low in density, not by
becoming compact, like nuclear star clusters (black filled circles). This suggests
that pseudobulges and nuclei are fundamentally different.

How can hierarchical clustering make so many bulgeless galaxies?

Hierarchical clustering in a cold dark matter universe (White \& Rees 1978) is
a remarkably successful theory of galaxy formation. The struggle now is with baryonic
physics. The most serious problem has been emphasized many times, both by observers
(e. g., Freeman 2000; KK04; Kormendy \& Fisher 2005; Carollo et al.~2007;
Kormendy 2008) and by modelers (e. g., Steinmetz \& Navarro 2002;
Abadi et al.~2003). Given so much merger violence,
how can hierarchical clustering produce so many pure disk galaxies with no signs of
merger-built bulges? This problem gets harder when we realize that many of what we used
to think are small bulges are really pseudobulges made by secular evolution. We know of
no Sc or later-type galaxy with a classical bulge (KK04). So the solution to the
above problem is not to hope that bulgeless disks are rare enough that they can be
explained as the tail of a distribution of formation histories that included a few
fortuitously mergerless galaxies.

This section provides new examples and better statistics on bulgeless disks.

The bulgeless disks that most constrain our formation picture are those that live
in high-mass dark halos -- say, ones in which circular-orbit rotation velocities are
V_ circ 200 km s^-1. Kormendy et al.~(2009) have used the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope to obtain high-resolution (instrumental dispersion _ instr 8
km s^-1) spectroscopy of the nuclear star clusters in M 101 and NGC 6946.
M 101 is an Scd galaxy with V_ circ = 210 15 km s^-1
(Bosma et al.~1981). But its nucleus has a velocity dispersion
= 25 7 km s^-1 like that of a big globular cluster. NGC 6946 is a similar
Scd with V_ circ = 210 10 km s^-1 (Tacconi \& Young 1986; Sofue 1996)
and = 38 3 km s^-1. IC 342 is a third such galaxy with
V_ circ = 192 5 km s^-1 (Rogstad, Shostak, \& Rots 1973; Sofue 1996) and
= 33 3 km s^-1 (B\"oker et al.~1999;
_ instr = 5.5 km s^-1). All three galaxies show small central upturns in
their J brightness profiles (Jarrett et al.~2003) and NGC 6946 and IC 342
also show rapid rises in their central CO rotation curves V(r) (Sofue 1996). But their
small dispersions V show that these are pseudobulges. How did these halos
grow so large with no signs of major mergers?

Could bulgeless disks be rare enough to have formed as the quiescent tail of a
distribution of merger histories? We believe that the answer is ``no''. Consider first
the Local Group. Only our Galaxy has uncertainty in its bulge classification. The
box-shaped structure implies a pseudobulge. The low velocity dispersion of the bulge
merges seamlessly with that of the disk (Lewis \& Freeman 1989). The central
profile derived by Tremaine et al.~(2002) implies a pseudobulge.
Only the old, -element-enhanced stellar population is suggestive of a classical
bulge (KK04 discusses these caveats). In agreement with Freeman (2008), we conclude that
there is no photometric or dynamical evidence for a classical bulge. Then
the Local Group contains one elliptical, M 32, and one classical bulge,
in M 31. In the most massive three galaxies, there is only one classical bulge.

Looking beyond the Local Group, the most distant bulgeless disk discussed above is
M 101. Its Cepheid distance modulus is m - M = 29.34 0.10; i. e.,
distance = 7.4 0.3 Mpc (Ferrarese et al.~2000), and V_ circ = 210 15
km s^-1. We will be conservative and look for all galaxies with V_ circ > 150
km s^-1 or central > 106 km s^-1 and m - M < 29.5. HyperLeda and
Tonry et al.~(2001) provide 19 such galaxies. M 101, NGC 6946, and IC 342,
are 3/19 of the big galaxies in our sample volume. Of the rest, 8 are dominated by
pseudobulges with no sign of a classical bulge. One more, NGC 2787, has a dominant
pseudobulge but could also have a small classical bulge component. Three galaxies in
the above volume are ellipticals, Maffei 1, NGC 3077 (probably), and NGC 5128. Three
galaxies are known to have classical bulges, M 31, M 81, and NGC 4258.
NGC 5195, the companion of M 51, has an uncertain classification but
= 157 km s^-1; we include it among the classical bulges. This leaves us
with the following statistics: Within 8 Mpc of us, 11 of 19 galaxies with
V_ circ > 150 km s^-1 show no evidence for a classical bulge, one may contain
both a classical bulge and a pseudobulge, and 7 of 19 are either ellipticals or contain
classical bulges. Big galaxies with evidence for a major merger are less than half of the sample.

In contrast, in the Virgo cluster, about 2/3 of the stellar mass is in
elliptical galaxies and some additional mass is in classical bulges (KFCB). So
the above statistics are a strong function of environment.

We therefore restate the theme of this section: What is special about
galaxy formation in low-density, Local-Group-like environments that allows > 1/2
of the galaxies with halo V_ circ > 150 km s^-1 to form
with no signs of major mergers?
