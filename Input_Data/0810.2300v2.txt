abstract

We describe a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues which are
well suited for use in conjunction with large photometric surveys.
We use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Bower et al.
implemented in the Millennium N-body simulation of the evolution
of dark matter clustering in a cosmology.
We apply our method to the specific case of the surveys
soon to commence with PS1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the
Pan-STARRS system. PS1 has 5 photometric bands, g, r, i, z and y
and will carry out an all-sky ``3 '' survey and a medium
deep survey (MDS) over 84 sq. deg.
We calculate the expected magnitude limits for extended sources
in the two surveys. We find that, after 3 years, the 3 survey
will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10 million
of which will lie at redshift z>0.9, while the MDS will have detected
over 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z>2.
These numbers at least double if detection in the shallowest band, y
is not required.
We then evaluate the accuracy of photometric redshifts estimated
using an off-the-shelf photo-z code.
With the grizy bands alone it is possible to
achieve an accuracy in the 3 survey of z/(1+z) 0.06
in the range 0.25<z<0.8, which could be reduced by about 15\
near infrared photometry from the UKIDDS survey, but would increase by
about 25\
the MDS an accuracy of z/(1+z) 0.05 is achievable for
0.02<z<1.5 using grizy.
A dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting
only red galaxies. In this case, z/(1+z) 0.02-0.04 is
achievable for 100~million galaxies at 0.4<z<1.1 in the 3
survey and for 30~million galaxies in the MDS at 0.4<z<2.
We investigate the effect of using photometric redshifts in the
estimate of the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale. We find that PS1
will achieve a similar accuracy in this estimate as a spectroscopic
survey of 20 million galaxies.

Introduction

Studies of the cosmic large structure were brought to a new level
by the two large galaxy surveys of the past decade, the
``2-degree-field galaxy redshift survey [2dFGRS;][]Colless01
and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [SDSS][]York00.
The former relied on
photographic plates for its source catalogue while the latter was
compiled from the largest CCD based photometric survey to date. Most of the
large-scale structure studies carried out with these surveys made use
of spectroscopic redshifts, for about 220,000 galaxies in the case of
the 2dFGRS and 585,719 galaxies in the case of the SDSS
. These surveys achieved
important advances such as the confirmation of the existence of dark
energy
and the discovery
of baryonic acoustic oscillations .
Yet, a number of fundamental
questions on the cosmic large-scale structure remain unanswered, such
as the identity of the dark matter and the nature of the dark energy.

Further progress in the subject is likely to require a new generation
of galaxy surveys at least one order of magnitude larger than the
2dFGRS and the SDSS. Unfortunately, measuring redshifts for millions
of galaxies is infeasible with current instrumentation. Attention has
therefore shifted to the possibility of carrying out extremely large
surveys of galaxies in which, instead of using spectroscopy, redshifts
are estimated from deep multi-band photometry. Although the accuracy
of these estimates is limited, this strategy can yield measurements
for hundreds of millions of galaxies or more. Several instruments are
currently being planned to carry out such a programme. The most
advanced is the Panoramic Survey Telescope \& Rapid Response System
.
Of an eventual 4 telescopes for this
system, the first one, PS1, is now in its final commissioning stages
and is expected to begin surveying the sky early in 2009. This
telescope is likely to be quickly followed by the full Pan-STARRS
system and by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope [LSST][]Tyson02.
Several other smaller photometric surveys are currently
underway [UKIDSS, Megacam etc.][]Lawrence07,Boulade03.

One of the important lessons learned from previous surveys, including
2dFGRS and SDSS, is the paramount importance of careful modelling of
the survey data for the extraction of robust astrophysical
results. Such modelling is best achieved using large cosmological
simulations to follow the growth of structure in a specified
cosmological background. The simulations can be used to create mock
versions of the real survey in which the geometry and selection
effects are reproduced. Such mock surveys allow a rigorous assessment
of statistical and systematic errors, aid in the design of new
statistical analyses and enable the survey results to be directly
related to cosmological theory. Mock catalogues based on cosmological
simulations were first used in the 1980s, in connection with the CfA
galaxy survey and redshift
surveys of IRAS galaxies and have been
extensively deployed for analyses of the 2dFGRS and the SDSS .

The recent determination of the values of the cosmological parameters
by a combination of microwave background and large-scale structure
data [e.g.][]Sanchez06,Komatsu08 has removed one major layer
of uncertainty in the execution of cosmological simulations. N-body
techniques are now sufficiently sophisticated that the evolution of
the dark matter can be followed with impressive precision from the
epoch of recombination to the present . The main
uncertainty lies in calculating the evolution of the baryonic
component of the Universe.

The size of the planned photometric surveys and the need to understand
and quantify uncertainties in estimates of photometric redshifts and
their consequences for diagnostics of large-scale structure pose novel
challenges for the construction of mock surveys. The simulations need
to be large enough to emulate the huge volumes that will be surveyed
and, at the same time, the modelling of the galaxy population needs to
be sufficiently realistic to allow an assessment of the uncertainties
introduced by photometric redshifts. At present, the only technique
that can satisfy both these two requirements is the combination of
large N-body simulations with semi-analytic modelling of galaxy
formation.

Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation are able to follow the
evolution of the baryonic component in a cosmological volume by making
a number of simplifying assumptions, most notably that gas cooling
into halos can be calculated in a spherically symmetric approximation
. Once the gas has cooled, these models employ
simple physically based rules, akin to those used in hydrodynamic
simulations, to model star formation and evolution and a variety of
feedback processes. The analytical nature of these models makes it
possible to investigate galaxy formation in large volumes and to
include, in a controlled fashion, a variety of processes, such as dust
absorption and emission, that are currently beyond the reach of
hydrodynamic simulations. [For a review of this approach,
see][]Baugh06. It is reassuring that the simplified
treatment of gas cooling in these models agrees remarkably well with
the results of full hydrodynamic simulations .

An important feature of semi-analytic models is that they are able to
reproduce the local galaxy luminosity function from first principles
[e.g.][]Cole00, Benson03, Hatton03,
Baugh05,Kang05,Kang06, Bower06,Croton06,deLucia06 and, in the most
recent models, also its evolution to high redshift
. These recent models also provide a
good match to the distribution of galaxy colours, which is
particularly relevant for problems relating to photometric
redshifts. And, of course, the models also calculate many properties
which are not directly observable (e.g. rest-frame fluxes, stellar
masses, etc) but which are important for the interpretation of the
data.

There are currently two main approaches to the estimation of
photometric redshifts. One employs an empirical relation, obtained by
fitting a polynomial or a more general function derived by an
artificial neural network, between redshift and observed properties,
such as fluxes in specified passbands
[e.g.][]Connolly95,Brunner00,
Sowards-Emmerd00, Firth03, Collister04. The
second method is based on fitting the observed spectral energy
distribution (SED) with a set of galaxy templates
[e.g.][]Sawicki97, Giallongo98,
Bozonella00,Benitez00, Bender01, Csabai03,
obtained either from observations of the local universe
[e.g.][]Coleman80 or from synthetic spectra
[e.g.][]Bruzual93,Bruzual03.
Some authors [e.g.][]Collister04 claim that the empirical
fitting method can give smaller redshift errors, but this method relies on
having a well-matched spectroscopic subsample that reaches the same depth in
every band as the photometric survey. Unfortunately, for Pan-STARRS
or LSST this is going to be challenging and to be conservative in this
initial investigation we use Hyper-z because it does not
require a training set.

In this paper, we describe a method for generating mock catalogues
suitable, in principle, for the next generation of large photometric
surveys. As an example, we construct mocks surveys tailored to
PS1. PS1 will carry out two, 3-year long surveys in 5 bands
(g,r,i,z,y), the ``3 survey'' which will cover three quarters
of the sky to a depth of about r=24.5 and the ``medium deep survey''
(MDS) which will cover 84 sq deg to a 5- point sources
depth of r=27 (AB system). The former will enable a comprehensive
list of large-scale structure
measurements, including the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and baryonic
acoustic oscillations. The latter will be used to study clustering on
small and intermediate scales, as well as galaxy evolution. To
construct the mocks we use the semi-analytic model of
[hereafter B06]Bower06 as implemented in the Millennium
simulation .
A sophisticated adaptive template method based on the work of
Bender01 will be employed for the genuine PS1 survey.
The method has been applied in the photo-z measurements of FORS Deep Field
galaxies and achieved z/(1+z_ spec) 0.03
with only 1\
calibration of zeropoints in all filters using the colour-colour plots
of stars, and a control sample of spectroscopic
redshifts. Consequently this method cannot be rigorously tested until
genuine PS1 data is available. Therefore, for a first look at
the photo-z performance of PS1, we adopt the standard SED fitting
method as implemented in the Hyper-z for our mock catalogues.

The paper is organised as follows. In 2, we briefly summarise the
models and detail the process of constructing mock galaxy
catalogues. In 3 we analyse some of their properties and in 4 we
use the mock catalogues to assess the accuracy with with photometric
redshifts will be estimated by PS1. In 5, we discuss how these
uncertainties are likely to affect the accuracy with which baryonic
acoustic oscillations, one the main targets for PS1, can be measured
in the survey. Finally, in 6, we discuss our results and present our
conclusions.

Mock catalogue construction

In this section we describe how we construct mock catalogues. In
2.1 we describe the semi-analytic galaxy formation code that we
use. In 2.2 we compare the luminosities and sizes of the model
galaxies to SDSS data and modify them to improve the accuracy of the
mocks. Finally in 2.3 we describe how the mock catalogues themselves
are built.

The first step in the process of generating a mock catalogue is to
produce a population of model galaxies over the required redshift
range. We use the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation to do this. galform calculates
the key processes involved in galaxy formation: (i) the growth of dark
matter halos by accretion and mergers; (ii) radiative cooling of gas
within halos; (iii) star formation and associated feedback processes
due to supernova explosions and stellar winds; (iv) the suppression of
gas cooling in halos with quasistatic hot atmospheres and accretion
driven feedback from supermassive black holes (see
Malbon06 for a description of the model of black
hole growth); (v) galaxy mergers and the associated bursts of star
formation; (vi) the chemical evolution of the hot and cold gas, and
the stars.

galform uses physically motivated recipes to model these
processes. Due to the complex nature of many of them, the model
necessarily contains parameters which are set by requiring that it
should reproduce a subset of properties of the observed galaxy
population [see][for a discussion of the philosophy behind
setting the values of the model parameters]Cole00, Baugh06.

galform predicts star formation histories for the population of
galaxies at any specified redshift. These histories are far more
complicated than the simple, exponentially decaying star formation
laws sometimes assumed in the literature [for examples of star
formation histories of galform galaxies, see][]Baugh06.
The galform histories have the
advantage that they are produced using an astrophysical model in
which the supply of gas available for star formation is set by
source and sink processes. The sources are the infall of new material due
to gas cooling and galaxy mergers and gas recycling from previous
generations of stars. The sinks are star formation and the
reheating or removal of cooled gas by feedback processes. The
metallicity of the gas consumed in star formation is modelled using
the instantaneous recycling approximation and by following the
transfer of metals between the hot and cold gas, and the stellar reservoirs
[see Fig. 3 of ][]Cole00.

The model outputs the broad band magnitudes of each galaxy for a set
of specified filters. In this paper we use the PS1 filter set (g,
r, i, z, y) , augmented by a few additional filters where some
of the PS1 galaxies may be observed as part of other observational
programmes (U, B, J, H, K). In addition to the magnitudes of
model galaxies in the observer's frame, we also output the rest frame
g-r colour, in order to distinguish between red and blue galaxy
populations. galform tracks the bulge and disk components of the
galaxies separately . The scale sizes of
the disk and bulge (assumed to follow an exponential profile and an
r^1/4-law in projection, respectively) are also calculated
[see][for a test of the prescription for
computing the size of the spheroid component]Almeida07.

The B06 model which we use in this paper employs halo merger trees
extracted from the Millennium N-body simulation of a -cold
dark matter universe . The model gives a very good
reproduction of the shape of the present day galaxy luminosity
function in the optical and near-infrared. Also of particular
relevance for the predictions presented here is the fact that this
model matches the observed evolution of the galaxy
luminosity function.

Improving the match to SDSS observations

To make the mocks as realistic as possible, we modify the luminosities
and sizes of the model galaxies to give a better fit to SDSS
data. Although both the b_J-band and K-band luminosity functions of
the B06 model have been shown to agree well with observations of the local
universe, the agreement is not perfect and a shift of 0.15 magnitude
faintwards in all bands improves the match to the data as can
be seen in Fig.~. The original B06 K-band luminosity
functions also match observations up to redshift z=1.5
, although the observational error bars are relatively
large. Hence, even after applying the 0.15~magnitude shift the
agreement between model and high redshift observations remains reasonably good.

The galform magnitudes we have been dealing with so far are
total integrated magnitudes. In reality all but the most distant
galaxies in the survey will be resolved over several pixels and will
have lower signal to noise in each of these pixels than a point source
would. To take this into account it proves convenient to use
magnitudes. These have the advantage over fixed
aperture magnitudes that, for a given luminosity profile shape, they
measure a fixed fraction of the total luminosity independently of the
angular size and surface brightness of the galaxy. The Petrosian flux
within N_p times the
Petrosian radius, r_P, is:

F_P=2 ^N_Pr_P_0I(r)r dr,

where I(r) is the surface brightness profile of the galaxy. The
Petrosian radius is defined such that at this radius, the ratio of the
local surface brightness in an annulus at r_P to the mean surface
brightness within r_P, is equal to some constant value ,
specifically:

= 2
^1.25r_P_0.8r_PI(r) dr/[ ((1.25r_P)^2-(0.8r_P)^2)]2
^r_P_0I(r)r dr/( r^2_P).

We choose the parameter values as N_P=2 and =0.2 as adopted
in the SDSS [e.g.][]Yasuda01.

We decompose the surface brightness profile of each galaxy, I(r),
into the superposition of a disk and a bulge: I(r)=I_ disk(r)+I_
bulge(r). The disk component is taken to have a pure exponential
profile:

I_ disk(r)=I_0e^-1.68r/r_d,

and the bulge a pure de Vaucouleurs profile :

I_ bulge(r)=I_0e^-7.67[(r/r_b)^1/4].

Given these assumptions, and assuming the disks are face-on,
we can compute the Petrosian radius by solving
Eqn.~() for each galform galaxy.

While galform does provide an estimate of the disk and bulge
sizes, it has been shown by Almeida07 that the early
type galaxy sizes of the B06 model are not in particularly good
agreement with the SDSS observational results. Therefore, for the
purposes of producing more realistic mocks, we modify the galaxy sizes
so as to match the SDSS results given by Shen03.

To do this we need to separate the galaxies into early and late types
and apply separate corrections to each population. First, we use the
concentration parameter defined as C=R_90/R_50 to separate our
galaxies into early and late types, where R_90 and R_50 are
the Petrosian 90\
calculate the ratio of the galform galaxy size to the mean found
by Shen03 for SDSS galaxies as a function of galaxy magnitude
and obtain the average
correction factor as a function of magnitude required for the
galform galaxies to match the SDSS size data. For early type
galaxies at redshift z=0.1
Shen03 parameterised the relation between
Petrosian half-light radii in the r-band, R_50, and absolute
r-band magnitude, M, as

(R_50)=-0.4aM+b,

with a=0.60 and b=-4.63. While for late type galaxies they found

(R_50)=-0.4
M+( - ) [1+10^-0.4(M-M_0)]+ ,

with =0.21, =0.53, =-1.31 and M_0=-20.52.
To correct the galform galaxy sizes at other redshifts
we adopt R_50 1-0.27z for late type galaxies and R_50
-0.33z+1.03 for early type galaxies. The former is the
relation given by Bouwens02 which agrees with a
combination of SDSS, GEMS and FIRES survey data
. The relation for early type
galaxies is obtained by taking a linear fit to the data given by
Trujillo06. Finally, we apply a linear relation
between R_50 and the Petrosian radius, R_50=0.47 r_P.

Building the mock catalogues

Our goal here is to generate mock catalogues which have
the distribution of galaxy redshifts and magnitudes expected
for the various PS1 catalogues. For the purposes of this paper,
we do not need to retain the clustering information contained in
the Millennium Simulation. We are effectively generating a Monte-Carlo
realisation of the redshift distribution expected for a given
set of magnitude limits. The production of mock catalogues
with clustering information will be described in a later paper.

There are 37 discrete output epochs in the Millennium simulation
between z=0 and z=3. The spacing of the output times is comparable
to the typical error on the estimated value of photometric redshifts,
as we will see later. To avoid the introduction of systematic errors
caused by the discrete spacing of simulation output times, previous
work to build mock catalogues used an interpolation of galaxy properties
between output times .
We follow an alternative approach in this paper. We have
generated nine additional outputs which are evenly spaced between
each pair of Millennium simulation outputs. To produce galform
output at each of these intermediate steps, the Millennium
simulation merger trees ending at the nearest simulation output are
used but their redshifts are re-labelled to match the required
redshift. Then galform computes the star formation history up to
the new output redshift, following the baryonic physics up to that
point. This results in a much finer spacing of effective output
redshifts which fully takes account of k-corrections, star formation
and stellar evolution, but ignores the evolution in the dark matter
distribution between the chosen output redshift and the nearest
simulation redshift.

To generate a mock catalogue with a smooth redshift distribution
we proceed as follows. At each of our closely spaced
grid of redshifts, z_i, we have a galform output dataset
consisting of a set of galform galaxies sampling a fixed comoving
volume V_ GF down to a sufficiently deep absolute magnitude.
To each of these
datasets we apply a magnitude limit and record the number of galaxies,
N_i, that remain. The comoving number density of galaxies expected
brighter than the limit is then n(z_i)=N_i/V_ GF and the number
we expect per unit redshift in the survey is n(z)
dV/dz/d , where is the solid angle of the survey and
dV/dz/d is the comoving volume per unit redshift and solid
angle for the adopted cosmology. This can be used to compute,
N(z_i)= ^z+ z/2_z- z/2(dN(z)/dz) dz, the number
of galaxies expected in the survey in a redshift bin z,
centred at a given redshift, z_i. To create a continuous redshift
distribution we sample at random this number of galaxies from the
corresponding galform output and assign them a random redshift
in the interval z such that we uniformly sample the volume
redshift relation. As we have perturbed the redshift of each galaxy, we
correspondingly perturb its apparent magnitude according to the
difference in distance modulus between the output and assigned
redshift. We will see that the residual redshift quantisation in the
evolutionary and k-corrections is small compared with the precision
achievable for the photometric redshifts. Therefore these residual
discreteness effects are not important in the photometric redshift
error estimation.

For the purpose of producing predictions for the redshift distribution
and number counts of galaxies in PS1 surveys, and to provide an input
catalogue with which to test photometric redshift estimators, we generate
a mock catalogue which corresponds to a solid angle of 10 square degrees.
We generate predictions for the 3 survey and the MDS by scaling
the results from this mock to take into account the difference in
solid angle. In a later paper, we will generate mock catalogues for
clustering applications which will have the full sky coverage of these
surveys.

Finally we need to apply the magnitude limit. To do this, we use a
Gaussian random number generator to sample the noise level N_r of
each galaxy for the specific survey under consideration. The galaxy
source flux S is also perturbed by its noise,
S_r=S+N_r. We apply a 5 cut for selection by rejecting
galaxies with signal-to-noise ratio lower than 5.

PS1 mock catalogues

In this section, we apply the methodology described in 2 to the
specific case of the PS1 survey. We begin by calculating the magnitude
limits which we expect to be reached in the 3 and MDS surveys for
both point and extended sources after one and three years of
observations respectively.

S=0.5~t 10^-0.4(m-m_1),

where m_1 is the magnitude that produces 1 electron per
second. The factor of 0.5 comes from
assuming the PSF is a 2D Gaussian profile and integrating over the
FWHM of this profile.

The signal-to-noise ratio for a point source is given by:

S/N=S/ ^2_ P+ ^2_ S+ ^2_ RN+ ^2_ D,

where ^2_ P=0.5t 10^-0.4(m-m_1) is the Poisson counting
noise for a source of magnitude m observed for t seconds;
^2_ S= 4 ^2 10^-0.4( -m_1)t is the
variance from the sky background, where is the average sky
brightness in magnitudes per square arcsec and , assumed to be
0.78 arcsecs, is the FWHM of
the PSF; ^2_ RN= 4 ^2 A^2 N_
read^2 is the read-out noise of the detector, where, for PS1,
A=3.846 pixels/arcsec and N_ read=5 is the read-out noise in
electrons; ^2_ D is the variance due to dark current and will
be assumed to be zero
. Table~ lists the
expected values of the parameters and m_1
and also
gives the 5 point source magnitude limits
resulting from applying this formula to the 3 survey and the MDS
after one and three years.

The signal-to-noise for resolved extended sources will be smaller.
To estimate this we take
the Petrosian radius and the redshift of a galaxy and obtain the
solid angle subtended by 2r_P of the galaxy, _g.
Then for extended sources, _ g> ,
we define the signal and the noise to be the values integrated
over the source aperture _g rather than the FWHM of the
PSF. Thus the signal is simply
S=t 10^-0.4(m-m_1), the Poisson noise ^2_ P=t
10^-0.4(m-m_1), the sky background variance is
^2_ S= 4 _ g^2 10^-0.4( -m_1)t
and the read-out noise is
^2_ RN= 4 _ g^2
A^2 N_ read^2. Since we have not convolved the image with
the PSF, this treatment would produce a sharp transition in the
noise level at the PSF limit. This can be avoided by approximating the
convolved diameter of the image by ( _g^2+ _P^2
)^1/2 and using this to replace _g in the
expressions
for ^2_ S and ^2_ RN.
Table~ gives the 5 point source magnitude limits
resulting from applying this formula to the 3 survey and the MDS
after one and three years.

A test of the PS1 mock catalogues

Before discussing predictions from our mock catalogues for the 3
and MDS PS1 surveys, we first carry out a simple test of the realism
of our mock catalogues. The galform semi-analytic model has been
shown to be consistent with various basic properties of the local
galaxy population such as the luminosity functions in the b_J and
K bands
.
The B06 version of the model also gives an excellent match to the
evolution of the rest-frame K-band luminosity function, including
the data from the K20 and munic surveys
up to redshift z=1.5
.

Since neither the b_J nor the K-band coincide with any of the PS1
grizy bands, for a more direct test we compare predicted galaxy
number counts in the r-band with data. At the faint end we use the
number counts over 5 sq deg from the deep2 survey
, which are complete to 24.75 in
the R band. To minimise sample variance at the bright end, we
use galaxy number counts in the SDSS commissioning data
which cover about 440~sq deg and
are complete to r^*=21. (We have checked that the difference
between the commissioning data and more recent SDSS releases
is negligible). We
compute the galform model predictions, including uncertainties,
from 10 realizations of 10 sq deg mock surveys. The results, displayed
in Fig. , show that our model prediction agrees very well
with both the deep2 and the SDSS datasets. Note that we have
applied the 0.15 magnitude shift discussed in 2.2 to the model
galaxies.

Expected PS1 galaxy numbers counts and redshift distributions

We now discuss the expected population statistics for the PS1 surveys
predicted by our mock catalogues. We apply Petrosian magnitude cuts in
each of the PS1 bands and plot the expected galaxy number counts in
0.5~magnitude bins in Fig.~, for both the 3-year 3
survey and the MDS. The figure shows that, with the Petrosian
magnitude cuts, the samples are no longer complete to the 5
point source magnitude limits in the various bands, but rather only to
2 magnitudes brighter. Note that the y-band magnitude limit is
substantially shallower than the others and so, if one requires
detection in all five bands, the y limit is the most restrictive.

The cumulative distributions on the right hand panels of
Fig.~ reveal the staggering number of galaxies that will be
detected by PS1. For example, in the g-band after 3 years, we expect
about 10^9 galaxies in the 3 survey and nearly 10^8 in the
MDS.

The expected redshift distributions for the two surveys are shown in
Fig.~ for galaxies detected in all 5 bands and in
Fig.~ for galaxies detected only in g, r, i and z,
i.e. not requiring the shallow y-band detection.
In the first case, the n(z)
distribution peaks at z 0.5 for the 3 survey, with about
8 10^7 and 1.8 10^8 galaxies detected (in all 5 bands)
in the 1- and 3-year surveys respectively. The survey is so huge,
that, after 3 years, we expect about 10 million galaxies at z>0.9
and 5 million at z>1.
For the MDS
survey, the n(z) distribution peaks at z 0.8, with a total of
1.7 10^7 galaxies after 3 years of which around 0.5~million
lie at z>2. Removing the y-band constraint leads to a large
increase in the number of galaxies, as shown in Fig.~. In
this case, the 3 survey will contain 5 10^8 galaxies
after three years, with about 30 million at 1<z<1.3, while the MDS
will contain 3 10^7 galaxies, with 4 million at z>2.

For certain applications, for example, for the estimate of photometric
redshifts discussed in the next section, it might be desirable to
supplement the PS1 grizy filter system with other bands,
particularly in the near infrared. The UKIDSS Infrared Deep Sky Survey
[e.g.][]Lawrence07,Hewett06 is
particularly relevant in this context. The UKIDSS Large Area Survey
(LAS) aims to map about 4000~sq deg of the Northern sky (contained
within the 3 survey) over the course of a few hundred nights. The
Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS) aims to cover 35~square degrees of the
sky in three separate regions which have a large overlap with the
fields chosen for the MDS. Details of the J, H and K magnitude
limits of the UKIDSS surveys are listed in Table~. In order
to assess the compatibility of the PS1 and UKIDSS surveys, we show in
Fig.~ the reduction in galaxy counts, relative to a pure
r-band selection, that would result from combining in turn each of
the filters with the r-band filter. We see, once again, that the
y-band cut (green line) is much shallower than the other PS1
bands. The UKIDSS (LAS) J, H and K bands are even
shallower. Combining r-band and U-band detections also results in
a large reduction in the counts even for an optimistic U-band limit
of 23 mag. Fig.~ suggests that, in spite of the large area
overlap with the 3 survey, the UKIDSS (LAS) survey may be too
shallow to pick up PS1 galaxies at high redshifts. It will be very
difficult for a U-band survey to pick up a significant number of PS1
galaxies.

Photometric redshifts in the PS1 survey

We now examine the accuracy with which redshifts are likely to be
estimated using PS1 photometry. For this purpose we adopt an
off-the-shelf photometric redshift code, the Hyper-z code of
Bozonella00 which is based on fitting template spectra.
We do not attempt to tune the performance of the estimator in anyway,
and so our results should perhaps be regarded as providing a
pessimistic view of the photometric redshift performance of PS1.
Once PS1 data become available, bespoke estimators will be developed
which are optimized to return the smallest random and systematic errors
for the PS1 filter set and galaxies by having empirically adaptive
galaxy templates [e.g.][]Bender01.

The basic principle behind the template fitting approach to photometric
redshift estimation is the following. The observed SED of a
galaxy is compared to a set of template spectra and a standard
^2 minimisation is used to obtain the best fit:

^2(z)= ^N_i=1 [ F_ obs,i-b
F_ tem,i(z) _i ],

where F_ obs,i, F_ tem,i and _i are the observed fluxes,
template fluxes and the uncertainty in the flux through filter i,
respectively and b is a normalization factor. For the fitting
procedure, we input the PS1 grizy-band filter transmission curves
and, when appropriate, those of the UKIDSS near infrared bands and a
U band filter. We consider different reddening laws and two
sets of model templates: the mean
spectra of local galaxies given by
[CWW]Coleman80 and the synthetic spectra given by
[BC]Bruzual93. We set a redshift range
of 0<z<3 for the 3 and 0<z<4 for the MDS sample.

One might be concerned that the use of Bruzual \& Charlot stellar population
synthesis models to generate both the template spectra and the galaxy spectra
in the mock catalogues might lead to an underestimate of the error on the
photometric redshift. There are two key differences between the mock spectra
and the templates which mean that this is not an issue: i) the complexity of
the composite stellar populations of mock galaxies and ii) the differing
treatments of dust extinction. The template spectra correspond to a single
parameter star formation history (characterized by an exponentially decaying
star formation rate, where the e-folding time is treated as a parameter)
and a fixed metallicity for the stars. The mock galaxies, on the other hand,
have complicated star formation histories which cannot be fitted by a
decaying exponential (see Baugh 2006 for examples of star formation histories
predicted by the semi-analytical models). Furthermore, the stars in the mock
galaxy have a range of metallicities. Hyper-z, in common with many other
photometric redshift estimators, assumes that dust forms a foreground
screen in front of the stars with a particular extinction law. In galform,
the dust and stars are mixed together. This more realistic geometry can lead
to dust attenuation curves which look quite different from those assumed in
the photometric redshift code .

The Hyper-z code calculates a redshift probability distribution, P(z), for
each galaxy. Because of a degeneracy between the 4000~ and the
912~
breaks, the shape of P(z) can have a double peak, causing some low redshift
galaxies to be misidentified as high redshift galaxies and viceversa. Some of
these misidentifications can be removed by applying extra constraints, for
example, the galaxy luminosity function and the differential comoving volume as
a function of redshift .
For a given
observed flux, both these functions provide an estimate of the probability that
the galaxy has redshift z which can be use to modulate P(z). The highest
peak in the combined probability distribution gives the best estimate of the
photometric redshift. We use the r-band luminosity function of the B06 model
for this purpose.

We now discuss how the accuracy and reliability of the photometric
redshift estimates depends on various choices. We do this by
calculating photometric redshifts for a 10 sq deg subsample of our
mock PS1 3 3-year catalogue and comparing these with the true
redshifts (which we will sometimes refer to as the ``spectroscopic''
redshifts.)

1. Choice of SED template (CWW vs BC)

Our tests show that using 5 input spectral types: burst, S0, Sa, Sc
and Im, gives good results; adding more spectral types does not
produce further significant improvement. We find that fitting with
the CWW templates gives larger statistical uncertainties and systematic
deviations from the true redshift than fitting with the BC templates,
especially at high redshift (z>1). The reason for this could be
that the CWW templates are based on observations of the local universe
and may not be sufficiently representative of galaxies at high
redshift.
In what follows, we will exclusively use the BC templates.

We also experimented with BC templates for different
metallicities. Because of the age-metallicity degeneracy in galaxy
SEDs, we did not find any improvement by allowing the metallicity to
vary while letting the age of the stellar populations be a free
parameter. Since the 4000~ break only becomes detectable after a
stellar population has aged beyond 10^7 years, we exclude templates
with ages smaller than this. This greatly improves the results for low
redshift galaxies (z<0.5).

2. Dependence on photometric bands

The accuracy of the redshift estimates depends on the choice of
photometric bands. With our 10 sq deg 3-year mock catalogues, we can
explore which combination of bands gives optimal results for PS1.
We have considered many combination of the PS1 grizy photometry
with UKIDSS (LAS) JHK and fiducial B and U photometry.
Note that,
if the flux through any of the U, B,
J, H or K filters drops below the 5 flux limit, the
noisy measured flux is still used with its appropriate uncertainty.

We find that the B-band (whose effective wavelength is very close to
the g band) does not improve the fits if U is available, but the
U-band is still useful even when B-band data are included. We also
find that the H-band is not important provided J and K are
available. However, both J and K are important for improving the
quality of the fits. Therefore, in what follows we will ignore B and
H. Our results are displayed in Figs.~ and~. In
Fig.~, we plot the ``spectroscopic'' redshifts against
our estimated photometric redshifts for the 4 cases above.
For clarity, rather than plotting each galaxy on these plots, we have
instead displayed contours that indicate the region in each bin of
photo-z that contains 50\
Galaxies with ``spectroscopic'' redshifts
falling outside the 95\
To evaluate the 1 scatter we eliminate extreme outliers through standard
3 clipping. Typically over f_ ret=95\
are retained, as indicated in the legend. Fig.~ plots the
true or ``spectroscopic'' redshift against our estimated photometric
redshift for the PS1 grizy photometry alone and when supplemented by
U-band photometry, UKIDSS (LAS) photometry, or both.
Fig.~
(left panel) shows z/(1+z)
plotted against redshift where z is the 1 error from
Fig.~. The bias in the mean of each redshift bin relative to
the true value is also shown (right panel).

The PS1 grizy bands alone give relatively accurate photometric
redshifts in the range 0.25<z<0.8, with typical rms values of
z/(1+z) 0.06. The random and systematic errors increase at both lower and
higher redshifts and there is a population of low redshift (z<1) galaxies
which are incorrectly assigned high redshifts. Adding the U-band
produces only a moderate improvement at all redshifts. Using both the J and
K bands results in a significant improvement at z<0.5, but not at
higher redshifts. Finally, combining the U, J and K, produces the
best results. For this best case, the rms error, z/(1+z)
0.05, in the range 0.5<z<1 and, for z<1.2, it is never larger than 0.15.

We saw in 3.3 that requiring that galaxies be detected in y, the
shallowest PS1 filter, reduces the sample size by factors of
2-3. The deeper sample that we achieve by only requiring griz
detections has significantly less accurate photo-zs. This is
shown in Fig.~, in which
we measure photometric redshifts using only griz photometry.
In this, the rms in the redshift range 0.25<z<0.8 increases
from 0.06 to 0.075 and the bias changes little.

Photometric redshift estimates for the MDS are shown in the top 2
panels of Fig.~ and their accuracy is quantified by the
green and blue lines in Fig.~. If only the PS1
grizy are available, an accuracy of z/(1+z) 0.05 is
achievable for 0.02<z<1.5. Adding the UKIDSS (DXS) and the U-band
improves the estimates considerably, but there is still a clear bias
at very low and high redshifts. This is mainly because the depths of the
UKIDSS (DXS) and our assumed U band is insufficient to match the
depth of the MDS so faint galaxies are not detected in the UKIDSS J
and K band nor in the U band.

For certain applications, for example, the measurement of baryonic
acoustic oscillations discussed in the next section, smaller rms
errors than those found above are required. These can be achieved by
selecting subsamples of galaxies whose spectra are particularly well
suited for the determination of photometric redshifts, such as red
galaxies which have strong 4000~ breaks. The most direct way to
define a red subsample is by using the rest frame g-r colours. In
Fig~, we plot the predicted rest-frame g-r against
r-band luminosity at four different redshifts in our mock MDS
catalogue. A cut at M_g-M_r>-0.04M_r-z/15.0-0.25 neatly separates
out the red sequence, particularly at z<1. The redshift
distributions of red galaxies defined this way are shown by the red
lines for both the 3 survey and the MDS in Figs.~
and~. The distributions peak at slightly lower redshifts
than the full samples, but there is still an impressive number of red
galaxies in the two surveys. For example, in the 3 survey we
expect about 200 million galaxies after 3-years if detection in y is
not required or 100 million if it is.

In practice, rest-frame g-r colours are difficult to estimate from
the observations. An alternative method for identifying red galaxies
is to use the spectral type determined by Hyper-z. We define a red
sample by the following criteria, galaxies which are best fit with
the `Burst' spectral type and a stellar population older than 10^9yr.

Fig.~ shows the redshift distribution for this
sample which can be seen to be very similar to the redshift
distribution of a red sample selected by rest-frame g-r colour. This
suggests that it will be possible to select a red galaxy sample
directly from the observational data alone.

Fig.~ and Fig.~ show
photometric redshift estimates for red galaxies in the 3-year 3
survey and the MDS respectively. Their accuracy is illustrated by
the magenta (grizy photometry only) and red lines (grizy+JK+U) in
Figs.~ and Fig.~ respectively. Results without the
y-band photometry are shown in the top panels of Fig.~ and in
green (griz photometry only) and blue (griz+JK+U) lines in
Fig.~. These figures show the dramatic improvement in
photometric redshift accuracy for red galaxy samples. For example, for
the 3 survey, the rms value of z/(1+z) can be as
low as 0.02 at z 0.8 when combining grizy with UKIDSS (LAS)
and U bands measurements. Similarly, in the MDS with the same combination of
filters, the accuracy for red galaxies is much higher than for the
sample as a whole and can be as good as z/(1+z) 0.03 in
the redshift range 0.75<z<2.5.

Finally, we consider the form of the distribution of the photo-z errors in
Fig.~. The photo-z error distributions are well fitted by
a Gaussian function, with variance _z _z.
The error distribution could also be equally well fitted by a
Lorentzian function. Example distributions are shown at z 0.3 and
\ 0.5 in Fig.~.
An application of our results for the size and form of the photo-z
errors is presented in the next section,
in which we investigate their effect on the baryonic
acoustic oscillation measurements.

Implications for BAO Detection

In this section we investigate the impact of using photometric
redshifts on the accuracy with which the baryonic acoustic oscillation
(BAO) scale can be measured from the power spectrum of galaxy
clustering. BAOs have been proposed as a standard ruler with which the
properties of the dark energy may be measured
.
Our aim here is to provide a simple quantification of the factor by
which the effective volume of a survey is reduced when photometric
redshifts are used in place of spectroscopic redshifts. This will
provide a rule of thumb indicator of the relative performance of
photometric and spectroscopic surveys for the measurement of BAO.
We defer a more extensive treatment of the full impact of the survey
window function on the measurement of BAOs to a later paper. Mocks with
clustering will play an important role in assessing the optimal way to
measure the clustering signal in photometric surveys.

The photometric redshift technique allows large solid angles of sky to
be covered to depths exceeding those accessible spectroscopically at a
low observational cost. However, the inaccurate determination of a
galaxy's redshift
results in an uncertainty in its position and this leads to a distortion
in the pattern of galaxy clustering. We shall refer to a measurement
of the power spectrum which uses photometric redshifts to assign
radial positions as being in ``photo-z" space.

The errors introduced by photometric redshifts can be modelled as
random perturbations to the radial positions of galaxies.
As we have found from our photo-z measurements that the photo-z errors
can be well fitted by a Gaussian function, if we assume that these
perturbations are Gaussian
distributed
with mean equal to the true redshift and width
_ z z, then the Fourier transform of the measured
density field, _ pz( k), can be written
as

_ pz ( k) = _ z ( k) \,
(-0.5 k_ z^2 \, _ z^2) ,

where k_ z = k . z ,
z is the line-of-sight direction
and _ z( k) is
the density field
measured in redshift
space. From this expression, the spherically averaged power spectrum
can be approximately It is an approximate expression since
the redshift space distortions and photometric redshift errors do not
commute under a spherical average [see][]Peacock94.
written as:

P_ pz (k) = P_ z (k) \, 2 \, Erf(k
\, _ z) k _ z ,

where
Erf(x) = 2 _0^x (-t^2) dt
is the error function.
In addition, the power spectrum in photo-z space can be seen as that
in redshift space with additional damping on small scales due to the
large value of _z. On very large scales the main contribution
to the power spectrum comes from modes with wavelengths larger than
the typical size of the photometric redshift errors. Therefore, the
clustering on these scales is essentially unaffected. On the contrary,
on scales comparable to and smaller than the photo-z errors,
structures are smeared out along the line-of-sight. The modes
describing these scales along the line-of-sight contain little
information about the true distribution of galaxies and contribute
only noise to the power spectrum.

The mean and standard deviation of the dark matter power spectrum
averaged over an ensemble of 50 N-Body simulations at z=0.5. The
top-panels display the power spectrum in three different cases: (i)
redshift space (solid red line), (ii) photo-z space (blue line) in
which the position of each dark matter particle has been perturbed to
mimic the effect of photometric redshift errors, and (iii) the
photo-z space power spectrum derived from Eq.~() and
the measured redshift space power spectrum (red dashed lines). The
horizontal dashed line illustrates the shot-noise level. In the
bottom panels we plot the photo-z power spectrum divided by a smooth
reference spectrum. This reveals the impact of photometric redshift
errors directly on the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). An
increase in these errors causes an increase in the noise and a
decrease in the amplitude of the BAO at high wavenumber. This implies
that photometric redshifts affect scales much larger that the
photometric redshift errors due to an effective reduction of the
number of Fourier modes and the smearing of the underlying true
clustering.

We investigate these effects directly on the measurement of the matter
power spectrum using large N-body simulations. We use the
l-basicc ensemble of Angulo08, which consists of
50 low-resolution, large volume simulations. Each has a volume of 2.4
( pc/h)^3 and resolves halos more massive than 1
10^13 \, M_ /h. The assumed cosmological parameters are
_m=0.25, _ =0.75, h=0.73, n=1 and
_8 = 0.9. Their huge volume makes the l-basicc
simulations ideal to study the detectability of BAO in future
surveys. Photometric redshift errors are mimicked as a random
perturbation added to the particles' position along one direction
(line-of-sight). The perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian
distribution with various widths representing different degrees of
uncertainty in the photometric redshift.
Despite their large volume, the l-basicc boxes are more than an
order of magnitude smaller than the volume which will be covered
by the 3 survey. Hence, we present results for the relative
change expected in the random errors for different photometric redshift
errors. Angulo et~al. found that any systematic error in the recovery
of the BAO scale was comparable to the sampling variance between
l-basicc realizations. To address the question of systematic
errors we will need to use even larger volume simulations. Furthermore,
new estimators are likely to be developed to extract the optimal BAO
signal from photometric surveys. These more detailed questions are
deferred to a later paper.

In the upper panels of Fig.~ we show the mean, spherically
averaged power spectrum of the dark matter measured from the
l-basicc simulations at z=0.5, along with its variance, in
photo-z space (solid blue lines). The size of the photo-z errors
are _z = 0.01 and _z = 0.04 (equivalent to 15.8 and
63.4 h^-1Mpc at z=0.5) in the left- and right-hand panels
respectively. We have also plotted the power spectrum measured in
redshift-space (solid red lines) and the analytical expression of
Eq.~ (dashed red line). By comparing the spectra in
redshift and photo-z spaces, the additional damping described above
is evident. Also, we see that Eq.~ describes
quantitatively this extra damping on scales where the power spectrum
is not shot-noise dominated.

In the lower panels of Fig.~ we take a closer look at the
BAO by isolating them from the large-scale shape of the power
spectrum. We do this by dividing the power spectrum by a smoothed
version of the measurement. It is clear that since the number of
``noisy modes'' increases with the size of the photometric redshift
errors, the error on the power spectrum and therefore on the BAO also
increases. The visibility of the higher harmonic BAO is also reduced
as the photometric redshift error increases. In order to quantify the
loss of information, we have followed a standard technique to measure
BAO as described in Angulo08 (see also
Percival07 and Sanchez08). The
method basically consists of dividing the measured power spectrum by a
smoothed version of the measurement. In this way, any long wavelength
gradient or distortion in the shape of the power spectrum is removed
which diminishes the impact of possible systematic errors due to
redshift space distortions, galaxy bias, nonlinear evolution and, in
the case described in this paper, photometric redshift
distortions. Then, we construct a model ratio using linear
perturbation theory, P_ lt/P_ smooth, which we fit to the
measured ratios. In the fitting procedure there are two free
parameters: (i) a damping factor to account for the destruction of BAO
peaks located at high k by non-linear effects and redshift-space
distortions and (ii) a stretch factor, , which quantifies how
accurately we can measure the BAO wavelength. The latter gives a
simple estimate of how well we can constrain the dark energy equation
of state from BAO measurements alone.

Fig~ shows the results of applying our fitting procedure
to the l-basicc ensemble at different redshifts. On the x-axis
we plot the size of the photometric redshift error divided by (1+z),
whilst on the y-axis we plot the predicted error on divided
by the error we infer for an ideal spectroscopic survey (i.e. from the
power spectrum in redshift-space). Since the error on scales
with the error on the power spectrum and the latter is proportional to
the square root of the volume of the survey, the y-axis should be
roughly equal to the square root of the factor by which the volume of
a photometric redshift needs to be larger than the volume of a
spectroscopic survey to achieve the same accuracy.

Several authors have investigated the implications of photometric
redshift errors on the clustering measurements in general and on the
BAO in particular
. Our analysis improves upon these studies in
several ways: (i) we have included photometric redshift errors
directly into an realistic distribution of objects; (i) by using
N-body simulations, our calculation takes into account the effects
introduced by nonlinear evolution, nonlinear redshift-space
distortions and shot noise; (iii) the use of 50 different simulations
enables a robust and realistic estimation of the errors on the power
spectrum measurements; (iv) we have investigated how our results change
if we use the actual distribution of photometric redshift errors
(the cyan and brown circles in Fig~), instead
of a Gaussian fit and we find only a small additional degradation.

These improvements lead to predictions that are somewhat different
from previous ones. For example, for z=0.03,
Blake05 predict a factor of 10 for the reduction
of the effective volume of a photometric survey. Here, as shown in
Fig.~, we find a reduction which is a factor 2 times
smaller than this (i.e. a volume reduction factor of 5). The
main difference between our analyses is that
Blake05 use only modes larger than k_ max =
2/ _z, arguing that wavelengths shorter than the size of the
photometric redshift errors contribute only noise. In reality, there
is a smooth transition around k_ max, with signal coming from all
wavenumbers (with different weighting, of course). In addition, the
neglect of nonlinear evolution (which erases the BAO at high
wavenumbers) also contributes to Blake05
overestimating the reduction in effective volume. These two effects
together explain the disagreement between our results.

Discussion and conclusions

We have described a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues
which are well suited to aid in the preparation, and eventually in the
interpretation of large photometric surveys. We applied our mock
catalogues specifically to the data that will shortly begin to be
collected with PS1, the first of the 4 telescopes planned for the
Pan-STARRS system.

Our mock catalogue building method relies on the use of two
complementary theoretical tools: cosmological N-body simulations and a
semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. For this study, we have
employed the Millennium N-body simulations of
Springel05 together with galaxy properties calculated
using the galform model with the physics described by
Bower06. Although this model gives quite a good match to the
local galaxy luminosity function in the B- and K-band, we refined the
match by applying a small correction of 0.15~mag to the luminosities
of all galaxies, so that the agreement with the SDSS luminosity
function is excellent. Similarly, we applied a correction to the
predicted galaxy sizes as a function of redshift in order to match the
SDSS distribution of Petrosian half-light radii in the r-band. As a
simple test, we showed that our galaxy formation model agrees very
well with the r-band number counts in the SDSS Commissioning and
deep2 data over a range of 12 magnitudes.

We adopt a similar magnitude system as the SDSS, based on the use of
Petrosian magnitudes and use these to calculate the expected magnitude
limits for extended objects in the two surveys that PS1 will
undertake, the ``3 '' survey and the MDS. We find that, after 3
years, the 3 survey will have detected 2 10^8
galaxies in all 5 photometric bands (g, r, i, z and y), with a
peak in the redshift distribution of 0.5 and an extended tail
containing about 10 million galaxies with z>0.9. The MDS will detect
2 10^7 galaxies, the redshift distribution peaking
at z 0.8, with 0.5 million
galaxies lying at z>2. Of the 5 PS1 bands y is the shallowest and
removing the requirement that a galaxy be detected in this band more
than doubles the total numbers in the sample.

We have used our mock catalogues to take a first look at the
accuracy of photometric redshifts in the PS1 photometric system.
Photometric redshifts can be readily estimated using the public
Hyper-z code of Bozonella00. With the PS1 grizy
bands alone it is possible, in principle, to achieve an accuracy in
the 3 survey of z/(1+z) 0.06 in the range
0.25<z<0.8. This could be reduced to 0.05 by adding J and
K photometry from the UKIDDS (LAS) and could be improved even further
with a hypothetical U band survey to 23 mag, although the samples
become progressively smaller as these additional bands are
added. Cutting
at the relatively shallow depth of the y-band
is important in achieving these errors. Going deeper than the y-band
data would increase the sample size substantially, but the
errors would increase to
0.075. There is therefore a balance to be struck between
reducing the sample size (by about a factor of 2)
which increases the accuracy of all the photometry, allows
the y-band to be used and has the combined effect of
increasing the photometric redshift accuracy. For the MDS an
accuracy of z/(1+z) 0.05 is achievable for 0.02<z<1.5
using the PS1 bands alone, with similar fractional improvements as for
the 3 survey by the inclusion of U and near infrared bands.

A dramatic improvement in photometric redshift accuracy can be
achieved for samples containing only red galaxies. We have shown that
it should be possible to identify a red sample (i.e. with red
rest-frame g-r colours) directly from the photometric data using the
best-fit Hyper-z templates. These samples can still contain large
numbers of galaxies. For example, an accuracy of z/(1+z)
0.02-0.04 may be achievable for 100~million red galaxies at
0.4<z<1.1 in the 3 survey. Similarly, for the MDS, this sort of
accuracy could be achieved for 30~million galaxies at
0.4<z<2. These estimates are all based on the ``off-the-shelf''
Hyper-z code, without any tuning of the code for the PS1 setup.
We expect that further improvements should be possible
by refining the photometric redshift estimator and tailoring it
specifically to the PS1 bands.

Our analysis is based on the use of the galform semi-analytic
galaxy formation model. Although this model gives a good match to a
large range of observed galaxy properties, it is based on a number
of approximations and has uncertain elements which could be relevant
to the estimation of photometric redshifts. These include the effects
of reddening, assumptions about the frequency and duration of bursts
and the use of the Bruzual93 stellar population synthesis
libraries which are the same as assumed in our implementation of Hyper-z.
We note that the star formation histories predicted by the model are much
more varied and have a richer structure than those assumed to construct
the Hyper-z templates, and that the treatment of dust extinction is very
different in galform.
Abdalla08 carried out a similar study to ours and reached
similar conclusions about the size of the photometric redshift
errors and the usefulness of additional filters in the NIR or far-UV.
This is encouraging as Abdalla et~al. used a completely different
photometric redshift estimator, ANNz, an artificial neural network
code written by . Furthermore, instead of using
a galaxy formation model to generate a mock catalogue, these authors
used a mixture of empirical and theoretical techniques to produce a
set of galaxies on which to test their estimator.

One of the main applications of the PS1 3 survey will be to the
determination of the scale of baryonic acoustic oscillations used to
constrain the properties of the dark energy. We have investigated how
uncertainties in the photometric redshifts will degrade the
determination of the BAO scale and, in particular, we have quantified
the factor by which the effective volume of a photometric survey is
reduced by these uncertainties. We find that, with the sorts of
photometric redshift uncertainties that we have estimated for a red
sample, PS1 will achieve the same accuracy as a spectroscopic galaxy
survey containing 1/5 as many galaxies. Unfortunately, spectroscopy
for 20 million galaxies at z 1$ is not likely to be feasible for
some time. PS1 should be able to provide competitive estimates of the
BAO scale in the next few years.
