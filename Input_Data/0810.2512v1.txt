Optical identification of IGR\,J18257-0707
June 23, 2008

abstract
We present the results of the optical identification of hard X-ray source
IGR\,J18257-0707 trough the spectroscopic observations of its optical
counterpart with RTT150 telescope. Accurate position of the X-ray source,
determined using Chandra observations, allowed us to associate this source
with the faint optical object (m_R 20.4), which shows broad
H_ emission line in its optical spectrum. Therefore we conclude
that the source IGR\,J18257-0707 is a type 1 Seyfert galaxy at redshift
z=0.037.

X-ray sources --- gamma-sources --- active galactic nuclei
--- optical observations

abstract

The hard X-ray source IGR\,J18257-0707 was discovered in INTEGRAL all sky
survey . This source is also known in literature as
IGR\,J18259-0706 [e.g.,][]stephen06. Our group systematically
observe unidentified INTEGRAL sources with the aim to determine their nature
.
In the case of IGR\,J18257-0707 the association of the X-ray source with
its optical counterpart was complicated, therefore we present the results of
the optical identification of this source in this separate Letter.

In soft X-rays the source was found also in ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and
is included in ROSAT Bright Source Catalog as 1RXS\,J182557.5-071021
. The error circle for this source is of 20
radius --- much more accurate than the localization error of INTEGRAL hard
X-ray source, which is 5 . However, this improved accuracy is
still insufficient to associate this source with some object in optical band
(Fig.~).

Position of the hard X-ray source was refined using the X-ray telescope
aboard SWIFT satellite, observations were made on Feb.\ 12, 2007. These data
give the following coordinates of the X-ray source: ,
=18:25:57.12, -07:10:24.4 (J2000). Astrometric uncertainty of this
position is about 6.5 \ and is mainly systematic .
Corresponding error circle is shown in Fig.~.

The object is located at low Galactic latitude, b=2.35^ , therefore
due to high stellar density in this area there are more than one optical
objects in SWIFT/XRT error circle. Spectra of some of these objects were
obtained with Russian-Turkish telescope (RTT150). In particular, using
TFOSC spectrometer we obtained the spectrum of the bright
(m_R 14.6) star, located within the circle (Fig.~). This
object appeared to be an ordinary K-type star and there is a fair
probability for such a star to be located in the SWIFT/XRT error circle by
chance.

In order to obtained more accurate position of the X-ray source we used
Chandra observations of this field made on Feb.14, 2008. With these data the
position of the source was determined with the accuracy 0.64 \ (90\
confidence): , =18:25:57.58, -07:10:22.8 (J2000). The
detailed results of Chandra observations of the source will be presented in
a separate paper .

Refined position of the source IGR\,J18257-0707 allowed to associate it
with the optical object, shown with arrow in Fig.~. This object
is located in about 7 \ from the center of SWIFT/XRT error circle, the
position of the optical object also coincides with the position of infrared
source 2MASS\,J18255759-0710229 from 2MASS survey .

The magnitude of the optical counterpart of IGR\,J18257-0707 is
m_R 20.4 and usually objects with similar magnitudes are considered
to be to faint for spectroscopic observations with 1.5-m telescope. However,
even for those faint objects, 1.5-m telescope is able to detect bright
emission lines if they are present in the spectrum of the source. With the
aim to search for these bright emission lines, with RTT150 telescope we
obtained a number of spectra of the source with 6300~s total exposure time.

In these observations we used the 100~ slit which corresponds to
1.78 \ in the sky and grism \#15 which provide the best optical
transmission and the most wide spectral coverage (3500--9000~ ). Spectral
resolution with this setup is 15~ \ (FWHM). The data were reduced
using standard IRAF http://iraf.noao.edu software. The
aperture for the extraction of the object spectrum was defined using the
spectrum of the nearby bright star which was also found in the slit.

The spectrum obtained in these observations is shown in Fig.~.
One can see the bright and broad emission line in the spectrum. The
equivalent width of this line is -276~ , full width at half maximum is
3600~km~s^-1. The lines with that large width are known only as
hydrogen lines in quasars and AGNs spectra. Also, that can not be a line,
where the other nearby bright lines are detected. For example, near the
H line one should detect the bright [OIII], 4959,5007
forbidden narrow emission lines, near the L line bright NV,
SiIV+OIV, CIV lines should be detected.

We conclude that this line should be identified with H line at
redshift z=0.037. In that case the object is identified as nearby type 1
Seyfert galaxy, which constitute the main part of extragalactic objects
among the optical identifications of new INTEGRAL hard X-ray sources
[see, e.g.][]bikmaev2006a,burenin08. The other emission lines which
are usually observed in Seyfert 1 galaxies are not detected here for the
following reasons: bright H_ and [OIII] lines are in blue part of the
spectrum which is heavily absorbed in Galaxy. Other lines near H_ ,
like [SII] are much weaker than H_ and are not detected due
to low signal-to-noise ratio in our data.

Spectrum corrected for interstellar reddening E(B-V)=2.01
is also shown in Fig.~ fig:sp. The overall shape of
dereddened spectrum is consistent with the presence of nonthermal continuum
which is typically observed in optical spectra of Seyfert galaxies
[e.g.,][]elvis94. The interstellar reddening E(B-V)=2.01
approximately corresponds to A(R) 5.1, therefore the brightness of
the object corrected for Galactic absorption should be 15.3. If the
AGN host galaxy were of comparable magnitude, it would be detected in the
optical images as an extended source. However, in our case we could not
reliably determine the object extent, because the observations are hampered
by PSF wings from the bright star in vicinity of the object. This is
illustrated in Fig.~.

The line of sight absorption column, measured in the X-ray spectrum of
IGR\,J18257-0707 with SWIFT is approximately n_H L =
(1.4 0.4) 10^22~cm^-2. From the other hand, the interstellar
reddening E(B-V)=2.01 with typical ratio n_H L/E(B-V)
4.8 10^21~cm^2 corresponds to the line of sight absorption column
about n_H L 1 10^22 cm^-2. Approximately the same value
n_H L 0.7 10^22 cm^-2 can be obtained from the HI map of
the Galaxy . Therefore, our data do not contradict to the
suggestion that the absorption observed in X-rays originate completely in
the disk of our Galaxy.

Thus, in result of our study of the hard X-ray source IGR\,J18257-0707 we
conclude that this source is an active galactic nucleus --- type 1 Seyfert
galaxy at redshift z=0.037.
